# Cavan's Website

The goal of my website is to display some fun side projects I have been working on. Movie data intrigues me, so I scraped IMDb to use some of their clean data. I also have my résumé here since it's easier to share a link than an attachment.

Check out my website at [https://cavandonohoe.github.io](https://cavandonohoe.github.io)

## Setup and Local Development

This website is built using R Markdown and deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

### Prerequisites

- R (>= 4.2)
- R packages listed in `DESCRIPTION`
- Pandoc (installed automatically by GitHub Actions, or via RStudio)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cavandonohoe/cavandonohoe.github.io.git
   cd cavandonohoe.github.io
   ```

2. Install R dependencies:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "knitr", "tidyverse", "rvest", "xml2", 
                     "httr2", "curl", "DT", "scales", "plotly", "glue", 
                     "here", "readxl", "googlesheets4", "ggplot2", 
                     "RColorBrewer", "pagedown", "lubridate"))
   ```

3. Set up Google Sheets authentication (for CV):
   - The site uses Google Sheets API for the CV
   - For local development, authenticate using `googlesheets4::gs4_auth()`
   - For CI/CD, a service account key is used (stored as GitHub secret)

4. Build the site locally:
   ```r
   rmarkdown::render_site()
   ```
   The site will be built in the `_site/` directory.

5. Preview locally:
   - Open `_site/index.html` in a browser, or
   - Use RStudio's "Preview" feature

### Project Structure

- `*.Rmd` files: Individual pages of the website
- `_site.yml`: Site configuration and navigation
- `_common.R`: Common R code (Google auth setup for CI)
- `header/header.html`: HTML header with meta tags and favicons
- `include_footer.html`: Footer with contact links
- `css/footer.css`: Footer styling
- `.github/workflows/`: GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- `data/`: Data files used by various pages
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts (e.g., ensuring gs4 guards)

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Sets up R and dependencies
2. Validates package dependencies
3. Authenticates with Google APIs using service account
4. Renders the R Markdown site
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages
