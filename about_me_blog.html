<h3>Week of May 16th, 2022</h3>
<p>Travelling to a new place for the first time can be both exhilarating
and nerve-wracking. Especially when it’s outside of your comfort zone. I
recently had the opportunity to travel to Madrid, Spain for a week,
which marked my first international trip outside of North America. And
let me tell you, it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>Madrid is a vibrant city filled with history, art, culture, and
amazing food. The city is a mix of old and new, with beautiful
architecture that has stood the test of time. One of the first things
that struck me about Madrid was the warmth of the people. From the
airport to the streets, everyone was friendly and welcoming, making me
feel right at home.</p>
<p>As I explored the city, I found myself constantly in awe of the
stunning buildings, monuments, and parks. The Royal Palace of Madrid,
with its intricate details and grandeur, was one of my favorite sights.
Walking through the Puerta del Sol, one of the busiest squares in
Madrid, I felt like I was part of the hustle and bustle of city
life.</p>
<p>But what I enjoyed most about Madrid was its food culture. From tapas
to paella, Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its bold flavors and
deliciousness. I visited many local restaurants and cafes, trying
everything from traditional Spanish dishes to fusion cuisine. My
personal favorite was a small tapas bar in the Malasaña neighborhood
that served the most amazing patatas bravas I have ever tasted.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during my trip was the language
barrier. Although many people in Madrid speak English, it was still
difficult at times to communicate effectively. However, I quickly
learned that a smile and a willingness to try to speak Spanish went a
long way in breaking down barriers and building connections with the
locals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my first international trip to Madrid was a
life-changing experience. It opened my eyes to a new culture, language,
and way of life. It taught me to be more adventurous and open-minded,
and to embrace new experiences with enthusiasm. I can’t wait to plan my
next international adventure and see what other exciting opportunities
await.</p>
<p>Also, I just thought of a little bit more to add to this…</p>
<p>Certainly, working remotely while traveling can be a unique
experience, and Madrid was no exception. Despite the time difference, I
was able to maintain my work schedule in the Pacific Time Zone while
enjoying everything the city had to offer.</p>
<p>One of the perks of working remotely while traveling is the
flexibility it provides. I could explore the city during the day, try
different foods, and visit museums and landmarks, all while still being
able to attend virtual meetings and complete my work tasks.</p>
<p>Working remotely also allowed me to immerse myself more fully in the
local culture. I visited local cafes and co-working spaces, where I had
the opportunity to meet locals and other travelers who were also working
remotely. It was interesting to learn about their experiences and how
they balanced work and travel.</p>
<p>Overall, working remotely in Madrid was a great experience. It gave
me the freedom to travel and explore a new city while also staying on
top of my work responsibilities. I would highly recommend it to anyone
who has the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>To get real for a sec: This was a good start to the trip. I started
walking a bunch and really enjoyed seeing everyone else there. It was
pretty warm there and there wasn’t great water in the Airbnb butttt it
was really awesome going to the nearby square to get more water. And
people were there till I was done working at 2am. I should have struck
up a conversation with some random people over there. Oh well, missed
opportunity.</p>

<h3>Week of May 23rd, 2022</h3>
<p>Biking the Amalfi Coast is one of the most iconic experiences in
Italy. The stunning coastal views, charming towns, and delicious food
make it a must-see destination for any traveler. But what happens when
you rent an electric bike and are too proud to use the electric part?
That’s exactly what happened to me during my trip to Naples, Italy.</p>
<p>After spending a week in Madrid, I was ready for my next adventure. I
decided to visit Naples and rent an electric bike to explore the Amalfi
Coast. However, when I picked up the bike, I forgot to turn on the
electric assist. As a result, I was left with a heavy bike that was
difficult to pedal, especially on the steep hills of the Amalfi
Coast.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging start, I decided to embrace the experience
and set off on my adventure. I took a train to Salerno, a town at the
southern end of the Amalfi Coast, and started my bike ride along the
winding roads that hug the coastline.</p>
<p>The views were breathtaking. The turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian
Sea sparkled in the sunlight, and the colorful houses perched on the
hillsides added to the charm of the towns. However, as the day went on,
I began to feel the strain of pedaling a heavy bike uphill.</p>
<p>At times, I had to slow down and catch my breath but never ever push
my bike. It was actually impossible to walk with a bike on the windy
streets of the Amalfi Coast just because the streets were so narrow. It
was exhausting though. But with each turn, the stunning views made it
all worth it. I passed through charming towns like Vietri sul Mare,
Amalfi, and Positano, each with its unique character and beauty.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, I reached the end of my bike ride and
arrived back in Sorrento. However, the adventure wasn’t quite over. When
I tried to take the bike on the train back to Naples, I was told that I
couldn’t because of the size of the bike. I had to pedal the entire way
back to Naples, which was challenging, but also a fitting end to the
day’s adventure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, biking the Amalfi Coast on a heavy bike was a unique
experience. While it was challenging at times, it was also incredibly
rewarding. The stunning views, charming towns, and sense of
accomplishment made it a trip I will never forget. It reminded me that
sometimes, the most memorable experiences come from stepping out of your
comfort zone and embracing the journey, even if it doesn’t go as
planned.</p>
<p>This trip also featured Janella and Becky who made the trip so much
better. I realized how nice it was to have a balance of seeing friends
and also doing my own thing. It does get lonely if it’s just me doing my
own thing days on end. But then again, you’d think I’d get lonely on
that massive 75 mile bike ride along the Amalfi Coast. But for some
reason, that felt great. This form of long term traveling seems to get
me to learn more and more about myself.</p>
