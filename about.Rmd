I know a resume/CV is supposed to show professional organizations what you know and how good you are at what you know. But it doesn't really get in the nitty gritty. It doesn't always show what you are truly passionate about. 

I am truly passionate on making life easier for people. If we don't have to waste time on the tedious, we can get to what we actually care about. If the passionate data analyst has to first collect the data in a rudimentary fashion, they will be drained by the time they actually get to the analysis. 

It is important for processes to be reproducible and scalable, even if they are ad hoc assignments. And as soon as those processes have been completed, they must be documented as detailed as possible so they can be reproducible by **anyone**. 

My father has been an actuary for more than 25 years and the biggest piece of advice he gave me was "if you are not available, make sure *anyone* can do your job. That doesn't mean your job is easy, it's because the documentation is so easy to comprehend."

I use that theme throughout my work life and make sure I explain everything in great detail to make sure everyone understands my analysis procedure. 

I am also a big volleyballer.
