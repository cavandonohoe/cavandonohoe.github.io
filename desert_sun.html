www.anamorphosisproductions.com INT. LIZ’S CAR, ELAPSING TIME UNTIL
PRESENT MOMENT Montage. Liz drives as Maggie drooling while napping,
drinks her water bottle, writes. Maggie is driving, bored out of her
mind. She throws something at a Liz sleeping. Liz wakes up, throws it
back and rolls over. MAGGIE I’m bored. Hang with me. Liz Do you hate me?
MAGGIE Never. Liz You’re acting like it. Maggie makes a face of disgust
and sits back in her seat. She takes a sip of her water bottle. Title.
EXT. REST STOP with Restaurant, night, Hours later The girls look like
they could’ve been hit by the bus they’re so tired. Wide, 1 medium of
Maggie, 2 shot. Maggie If I don’t eat, I’m going to morph. Stranger Into
what? Liz A raging bitch. They both stare silently, waiting for their
privacy. Stranger doesn’t get it. Maggie exits frame and Liz follows.
Tracking two shot. Maggie People have no boundaries nowadays. Liz Maybe
he wanted to be friends? Maggie Maybe… Liz Isn’t it weird how when we
aren’t interested in someone, they’re clingy or unbecoming? maggie Maybe
we’re the problem. They both think. Then at the same time realize it’s
their turn to be seated. Maggie’s phone rings. It’s her Grandfather.
MAGGIE It’s my Grandpa. Liz See you in a minute. Liz follows the server
to be seated. EXT. Bus stOP WITH diner, night, moments LATER Maggie
yells into the phone, for her Grandpa is hard of hearing. Maggie Hey
Grandpa! How are you? Grandpa Hello?? MAGGIE (beat. Then louder) Hey
Grandpa! How are you doing? Grandpa (vo) Good, I’m good honey. How are
you? MAGGIE I’m good. We just got to Joshua Tree. Grandpa Where? MAGGIE
Germany. GRANDPA I’ve been there. Went there in 1996 with your
Grandmother. MAGGIE Any highlights? GRANDPA It’s funny, I just remember
spending time with your Grandmother. MAGGIE That’s so sweet, Grandpa.
Grandpa And the Holocaust museums. Maggie Less romantic. GRANDPA What
was that honey? MAGGIE LESS ROMANTIC. It was a joke. GRANDPA Ahhhh, a
funny. You have a boyfriend yet? MAGGIE Nope. No boyfriend, flying solo.
GRANDPA Oy vey. Well alright. But just remain open. MAGGIE I will,
thanks Grandpa. GRANDPA I love you. Call soon. MAGGIE I will. I love you
bunches. GRANDPA I love you. Bye now. INT. DINER, MOMENTS LATER Liz is
sitting alone in a booth directly in front of where Maggie is standing
outside. She takes a moment after the phone call. As Maggie walks away,
a man sits down with Liz. Dan Hey, can I sit here for a moment? Liz
Someone’s actually / coming right back. He sits down. Liz / Okaaaay. Dan
Look, I don’t want to be intrusive, I just would love to talk to you for
a minute. What’s your name? Liz Liz. DAN Nice to meet you, I’m Dan. Liz
Nice to meet you. The shake hands. Maggie sees this in the wide. Her jaw
drops. She quickly closes it and tries to give Liz space. DAN Are you
staying here or passing through? Liz We’re going to Joshua Tree thirty
miles North of here. dan For the weekend? Liz I’m moving there for a
year. A long weekend for my friend. Dan Wow. You get a new job? Liz My
job is actually remote and I wanted a change of scenery. Pretty lucky.
Dan Pretty cool. Liz is touched. Maggie walks up, looking a bit
exhausted. Liz How was it? Maggie Oh you know, sad. Liz releases a
“mmm.” She gets it. Maggie Are you joining us? Liz No, he’s - Dan Just
getting her number? Maggie Totally dropped something. Or something.
Maggie walks away. Dan Can I have your number? Liz Okay, sure. She
writes it down. Dan takes the paper and folds it. Wide. Maggie is back
outside looking at her phone. Dan knocks on the window. Dan You can come
back now! Maggie Thank you for the invite. Dan Of course, I kept your
seat warm for ya. This made Liz laugh. He soaks it in as Maggie comes
back. Dan I’m Dan. Maggie Maggie. Nice to meet you. (she sits) Anything
we should order here in particular? Dan Pancakes. Maggie And a Bloody
Mary. Easiest decision all day. Liz I’m in. They close their menus. INT.
AIR B &amp; B, HOURS LATER Maggie This place is cute. Liz I love it
here. MAGGIE I can’t believe this is your home for the next year. Liz
Honestly, I can’t either. MAGGIE I’m so proud of you - you’re living
your dream. Liz Thank you for coming with me for the first weekend of my
journey. MAGGIE Thank you for letting me cramp your style. Liz You could
never. MAGGIE So you wanna hang with that guy tomorrow? He seemed nice.
Liz Yeah, I think I would. MAGGIE Fabulous. He should text you within -
Liz Already did. MAGGIE Okay queen. I’m gunna try and get some rest. See
you in the morning. Love you, mean it. Liz Love you, say it back. MAGGIE
Oh, so sorry. I love you. The girls exit frame. Int. Air B &amp; B, the
next morning, 10 am Maggie’s sitting at her desk over a blank page. Her
phone rings, it’s her grandfather. Maggie Hey Grandpa, how are you
doing? Grandpa Hey Honey! Maggie How are you doing?? Grandpa Good,
honey. How are you? MAGGIE Doing okay. Trying to write, but I just can’t
think of anything to say that has the potential of being interesting.
GRANDPA There’s a story of a poet that hears her work in the wind. She
waits until a poem comes to her, then she runs with the inspiration and
completes as much as she can. Maybe now just isn’t the right moment to
write. MAGGIE Maybe you’re right… thanks Grandpa. GRANDPA You’re
welcome, sweetie. What else is going on? Maggie Got to Joshua Tree last
night with Liz. GRANDPA Who? Maggie (louder) Liz. My best friend.
GRANDPA Besides me, you mean. Maggie Well obviously, but don’t tell her.
GRANDPA How come? MAGGIE I don’t want to hurt her feelings! GRANDPA Eh,
you win some you lose some. Anything else? Got a boyfriend? MAGGIE Still
no boyfriend, but if I get one tonight, you’ll be the first person I
call. GRANDPA Huh? Maggie No, no boyfriend. GRANDPA Alright honey. Well
have a great day. Okay? I love you. MAGGIE I love you too, Grandpa.
Thanks for believing in me. GRANDPA Bye bye now. Maggie Hey Grandpa?
GRANDPA Yeah? Maggie Will the missing of Grandma ever get easier?
GRANDPA Oh… you know, you two were very close. I think eventually you’ll
miss her and long for her, but it won’t ache as bad as it does now. But,
I also told you that years ago. Has it gotten any easier over the last
fourteen years? MAGGIE The first year felt like a blur… I definitely
feel better than then. GRANDPA Well the first year is full of firsts -
birthdays, Hanukah, anniversaries… the first year is always the worst. I
have to be honest with you though - Maggie Always. Grandpa Always. It
won’t ever go away completely, but I think that’s because love can’t be
destroyed. It has to morph into something else to fill the space. Maybe
try loving someone else the way you loved her. MAGGIE I love you that
much. GRANDPA Obviously, but you’ve always loved me that much. Maybe
someone else… maybe, Maggie Oh god… Grandpa A man… MAGGIE Okay, I’m out.
Love you, Grandpa. Grandpa Love you too, sweetie. Maybe the person is
yourself. MAGGIE Huh? GRANDPA Maybe you love yourself more. MAGGIE Huh,
yeah. Thanks. I’ll think about that. GRANDPA Love you, bye bye now.
MAGGIE Bye. Maggie hangs up the phone and doesn’t think on this. Liz
knocks on the door. Liz Any luck? Maggie I’m just dry. What if I can’t
sell another poem again? Liz Mags, you’re spiraling. MAGGIE Okay, okay
you’re right. Liz You’ve sold so many and won big slams. You just need
to be patient. And you’re on vacation, you don’t need to be working
right now. Maybe it’s refresh time. MAGGIE Okay… well I was reading
through some old journals and I have so many intense poems that I have
zero idea who they’re about? Liz Try me. Maybe I’ll be able to decipher.
Maggie It’s titled, I was your price tag. “Softness is the new weakness
I will avoid Because of all the jocks that stole my flirtations The
artists that plagued me with their facades and all the lost souls that
used me to climb back to the Earth. I am not your stepping stone to a
better life You can’t use me and move on stronger My love comes with a
price and Your robbery has left me with a deficit.” Liz I’m not laughing
at the poem. I just have no idea who that is about. MAGGIE I know, I
know. Me either. Anyway, distract me from my feelings of being obsolete.
Liz Honestly, perfect transition. Dan invited us to a party tonight.
Wanna walk around and grab dinner first? Maggie FUN. Yes,
absolutely.<br />
Liz I really don’t want to make a big deal of hanging with this guy.
It’s not even a real date - you’ll be there. MAGGIE Still a date, but we
won’t make a big deal of it. I want to take pictures to properly
document our first full day here. So we have to look cute. Liz Down. Be
ready by 3? Maggie Mhmm. Int. Air B &amp; B, Liz’s room, 1 MINUTES LATER
Shots of clothes being flown across the room. Piles of clothes on the
floor. Quick shots of Liz coming out + responses from Maggie as she lays
on the bed with a flask. MAGGIE Not that one. Liz goes back. Comes out
again in a new outfit. Maggie I don’t think so. Liz goes back. Comes out
again in a new outfit. Maggie Strong contender. Liz goes back. Comes out
again in a new outfit. MAGGIE Okay it’s perfect for a desert house
party. Liz How would you know that? MAGGIE Because I’m a dreamer, and it
fits in with the vision of tonight. Liz (shrugging off the logic) I’ll
take it. Maggie gets up. MAGGIE I’m gunna go to that little store we
passed to get snacks. Liz You want me to come with? MAGGIE Nah, take
your time getting ready. Liz You do love me. MAGGIE I’VE LOVED YOU
EVERYDAY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. Liz Lol. MAGGIE But not enough to laugh out
loud. I’ll “Always Remember Us This Way”. Liz Goodness, GO. Ext.
Sidewalk, ten minutes later Maggie walks down the sidewalk and into a
small little store. INT. SMALL STORE, MOMENTS LATER She grabs some
crackers, cookies, one handle of Vodka, a bottle of rum, OJ and some
eggs. She places them on the counter and gives an awkward smile. Cut to:
Int. KITCHEN, AIR B &amp; B, TEN MINUTES LATER Maggie is finishing
unpacking the eggs and OJ. She pours the rum into a flask. There are two
cocktails on the counter, one is half way finished. Liz comes out ready
for the evening. Maggie Okay you look incredible. And I still have to
shower. Liz Twenty minutes and counting. Liz looks at her watch and sets
a timer. Mags rises to the challenge. MAGGIE On it. Maggie finishes her
drink and runs out. Cut to: INT. AIR B &amp; B, bathroom 10 MINUTES
LATER Maggie is showering. Liz (v.o.) 10 minutes! Maggie Kay! Cut to:
INT. AIR B &amp; B, BATHROOM 5 MINUTES LATER Liz is sitting on the couch
playing Wordle. Liz Five! Actually, like four? Somewhere in between.
Maggie (v.o.) You’re a goddess. INT. AIR B &amp; B, 19 minutes LATER Liz
30 seconds!! Maggie comes stumbling out of the bedroom with one shoe on.
Maggie I’m done. I’ve done it. Liz You’re victorious. MAGGIE I’m a
champion. Liz How does it feel? MAGGIE Well, I’d like to thank my Mom,
and best friend, you. Of course. Liz So sweet. MAGGIE And no one else,
because the world is full of haters. Liz Okay, Plath. Let’s go. I’m
getting hungry. EXT. Sidewalk, one hour LATER They walk in the same
diner they went to before. Liz I know it’s not very adventurous, but I
liked this place. Down to go again? Maggie Let’s do it. They enter the
restaurant. INT. diner, moments later They sit at a different booth and
look at the menu. Waiter What can I get started for ya? Maggie Rum and
coke please. And the breakfast platter with waffles instead of pancakes.
Thank you. Liz makes a face at Maggie’s drink order. Liz I’ll have the
cheeseburger and fries please. The waiter walks away. Liz You really
have to order a drink right now? Maggie I’m pre-gaming. And we’re on
vacation. Live a little, join meeeeee. Liz I’m too nervous. Maggie It
could help your nerves. Liz Okay, I’ll order one. But that’s it. Maggie
Yessss. (the waiter walks by) Could we have two rum and cokes please?
Waiter Sure thing. Cut to: Int. diner, MOMENTS LATER There are four
empty rum and coke glasses, napkins on the table and the bill. Maggie
I’ll get this one. Liz You sure? Maggie Yeah, you got basically nothing.
Liz Let me throw you twenty bucks, the rum and cokes were more expensive
than I thought they would be. MAGGIE Yeah, same. Thanks girl. How far
are we from Dan’s party? Liz Fifteen minute walk. Maggie Incredible.
Ext. House, thirty minutes LATER Maggie sips her water bottle and Liz
stares at the door anxiously. Liz I’m nervous. Maggie He is lucky to
spend time with you. Liz Oh god- MAGGIE I’m serious. You’re a catch. And
he can see that. You ready? Liz Yes. Maggie rings the doorbell. Dan
answers and gives Liz a big hug. Maggie (mouthing) See? Never question
me. Liz rolls her eyes as Dan gives Maggie a hug hello. INt. House,
moments later Maggie Straight Vodka please. Dan Like a shot? Maggie Like
a double? Liz How do you do that? MAGGIE It’s like water. Liz Except
it’s not. Dan We don’t have Vodka tonight, we have Rum, Bourbon and
Seltzers. Liz Really? Hm, seltzer for me. Maggie Ohhhh, Bourbon for me.
Dan A double? Liz is a little embarrassed of Maggie’s drink order.
MAGGIE Good guess. Here, I’ll make mine, you can grab hers.<br />
They share a nice, friendly moment. Maggie pours a full cup when Dan
turns around. He hands her coke, she pretends to open it as Liz and Dan
talk behind her. Dan How long have y’all known each other? Liz Since we
were 11. Maggie So seventeen years? Dan Oh dang, that’s like me and my
buddy over there, Gabe! (addressing Gabe) Hey! Come here. Gabe crosses
over. Dan Meet Gabe, this is Liz and Maggie. Gabe Nice to meet you.
Maggie You too. Gabe We were just talking about playing some adult hide
and seek. You wanna play? Maggie YES. We love an excuse to be
competitive. Liz Absolutely! We see someone exits, someone’s arms as
they explain something as the girls speak via brainwaves. Maggie
(thought VO) He’s cute. Liz (THOUGHT VO) Full support. MAGGIE (THOUGHT
VO) Tonight is gunna be fun. They high five. title card: 3 hours LATER
INT. HOUSE PARTY, 3 HOURS LATER The frame is the same, but Maggie is
gone. Liz yells after her… Liz MAGS! Can I have some water? Maggie
doesn’t reply. Liz Mags! Ugh, she’s such a germaphobe that I feel bad
drinking out of her bottle. Gabe Isn’t she your best friend? Liz Yeah,
but that’s why I’m thinking about her feelings. Dan You’re so nice. Liz
I – ugh. Fine. She laughs off her frustration and drinks the bottle. She
immediately spits the liquid all over her date. Dan What the hell?! Liz
Vodka. That’s Vodka. Gabe What? Liz That’s straight fucking Vodka. Did
she fill that here? Dan We don’t have Vodka tonight. Liz gets up as
Maggie enters the room. Maggie Here I’ll take my bottle. Liz No, I’ll
keep it. Can we talk outside? MAGGIE Sure? Hand it to me, drunk one. Liz
No. MAGGIE Why are you acting so weird? Liz Why is it full of Vodka?
MAGGIE What? Liz I took a sip- MAGGIE You drank out of my bottle?? I
have like one boundary with you - Liz I know, I know - I’m sorry. MAGGIE
Give me my bottle. Liz No! MAGGIE Yes! Give it to me. It’s mine! Liz
What, are you four? Maggie reaches for the bottle, but Liz drunkenly
doesn’t want to let go. They start playing tug of war over it. Maggie
Give it to me! Liz Mags, you don’t need it. Let go! MAGGIE No! Liz Yes!
MAGGIE No! Liz Yes! MAGGIE FINE. Maggie lets go and the bottle hits Liz
hard in the face. EXT. House, moments later They are sitting on a curb
in silence, Liz has an ice pack on her head. The bottle is next to Mags.
Liz Do you think you’re an alcoholic? Maggie No. I don’t need it, it
just makes things easier. Liz How much do you drink a day? MAGGIE I
don’t know… Liz Mags. MAGGIE I don’t know - I don’t keep track. Liz How
do you even afford to drink that much? MAGGIE Since I’ve gotten my new
job, I haven’t had to worry about it. Before, it was part of my grocery
bill. Liz Mags. You can’t live like that. MAGGIE Like what? Liz Numbing
like that. All the time. Maggie It’s really not that bad. I think you’re
over reacting. Liz I knew you drank throughout the day, but I didn’t
realize that you were drinking constantly. Why? MAGGIE I’m fine. Thank
you, but really. I just find it all boring. Liz What? MAGGIE Life.
(beat) Don’t you find it all just boring? Liz Sometimes, but not all the
time. (beat) Do you think you’re depressed? MAGGIE Sometimes. But isn’t
everyone? I feel like I’m living with a clock in my face; counting down
the time until my Grandpa dies. Every minute passed, he’s a minute
closer. Liz You can’t think of it like that, Mags. MAGGIE What else is
life worth living for if not the people we love? Liz Is being drunk all
the time living? MAGGIE I’m not drunk all the time. Liz You’re not drunk
off of a water bottle filled with vodka? MAGGIE Fine, I’m tipsy all the
time. I have it under control. Liz I feel like I let you down a bit. For
not saying something sooner about the partying. I always knew you drank
a lot, but didn’t realize it was like this.<br />
Maggie Don’t. I didn’t want you to worry when I know everything is fine.
Liz Mags, I’m worried about you. I need you to talk to someone about
this when you get back. You deserve to let this shit out. Promise me.
MAGGIE I don’t know, Liz. I’m too messed up right now. Wide of them
sitting on the curb holding hands. INT. Liz’s Bedroom, the next morning,
9 am Mags is awake and writing in her journal. They are both in the same
clothes as the night before. Liz wakes up. Liz Mags? Maggie Yeah? Liz
Can today be your day one? Maggie What? Liz Can today be your first day
sober? MAGGIE Liz, I’ve never been without you and we are about to be in
different cities for a year. I don’t even think it’s healthy to go off
cold-turkey like that. Liz Okay… Would you go stay somewhere for
support? MAGGIE I don’t need to go somewhere, my god. I can barely
afford this vacation, how am I supposed to go somewhere? Liz I’m sorry,
that was stupid. What about AA? MAGGIE I’m not an alcoholic, Liz. Liz I
think you are. MAGGIE I think you should keep your thoughts about this
to yourself. Liz Woah, that’s never been our way. MAGGIE Well I’m
calling it. Setting the boundary. I don’t want to talk about this. Liz
Then I don’t want you to stay here. MAGGIE What? Liz What kind of friend
would I be if I just let you drink yourself to death? MAGGIE Drink
myself to death?? A little dramatic, don’t you think? Liz Secretly
drinking straight vodka out of a water bottle is dramatic, don’t you
think? MAGGIE You’re a partier. Liz I don’t drink vodka in bulk!! And I
know that flask has rum in it. You’re not being honest with me. MAGGIE
So now I’m a liar? Liz Am I wrong? MAGGIE You’re being an asshole,
that’s for sure. Liz Don’t push me away like that. MAGGIE Don’t make me.
Liz I’m not making you, I’m loving you. You just don’t like hearing the
truth. You’re addicted to alcohol. MAGGIE I’m out of here. Liz You push
everyone away, Mags. Don’t do it to me. I need you. MAGGIE Well
congrats, you lost a friend today. I push people away, but you have
always pushed people’s limits. Rather than thinking about me, why don’t
you ever reflect on why you don’t have other friends, huh? There’s gotta
be a reason why the only person you spend time with is so crazy that
they can’t keep anyone in their life! You’re just as messed up as I am.
Liz is taken aback. She’s hurt. Maggie realizes she took it one step too
far.<br />
Maggie I’m sorry. (covering up her anger about the alcoholism) I’m
scared to be without you. Liz I am too. And you don’t have to leave,
that was rude of me. Just promise me you’ll go to one meeting. MAGGIE
You’re still pushing me. I don’t want to stay. You’re pulling this
information out of your ass because you watch a lot of dramatic
television. Liz Everyone knows to quit you need support.<br />
MAGGIE I can’t change right now. Liz And I can’t be silent about this.
Maggie picks up her luggage to leave. Liz I look forward to talking to
you when you’re sober. They are both unsure if they are doing the right
thing. INT. diner, ONE HOUR LATER A glass of bourbon gets placed down on
the bar. Hands grab it. Medium of Maggie taking her first sip. She adds
some from her flask. INT. Bus, one hour later Shots of Maggie drinking,
crying and processing the conversation with Liz. She’s trying to write
but can’t come up with anything. Int. Subway, five hours later Maggie is
still drinking, very drunk. She tries to get up and drops all of her
stuff. She is obviously inebriated. Ext. Sidewalk, ten hours later She
stumbles walking home. Somehow she’s almost made it. Int. Living room,
one day later Empty bottles lay around, the place is a mess, smells
horrible and is pitch dark. The TV is on and a few candles are lit.
Maggie is drunkenly asleep on the couch. She wakes up to discover that
she peed herself. She gets up to shower, but falls onto the coffee
table, knocking over a candle. She sits it up right and crawls to the
bathroom, turns on the shower and gets in to clean off the pee. After
sobbing in the shower for some time, she falls asleep. Slowly her body
slumps down and she starts choking on the water. Her choking wakes
herself up and she turns off the faucet. She can’t live like this. She
searches her pants for her phone and opens a text to Liz. They haven’t
talked since she left three days ago. Maggie (text) I’m so sorry for
drinking too much. I’m scared to go to a meeting alone. Is there anyway
you could come with me? I know it’s asking a lot. EXT. Community center,
one week later Maggie smokes a cigarette outside. She’s holding her
water bottle. People occasionally walk by her. She stomps out the
cigarette and waits anxiously. Liz turns the corner. They hug for a long
time. Maggie I’m so sorry. You were trying to help me and I let my fear
get in the way of us. Liz I think I pushed you too hard too fast. I just
got so worried, I felt like I had to stand my ground. MAGGIE I’m so
sorry. Liz Me too. They hug. Maggie Liz, I’m scared. Liz I know. I’m
here. I’m here now. They release each other, hold hands, Mags takes a
deep breath and wipes her face. Maggie Are you still seeing Dan? Liz
(with a small laugh) What? MAGGIE I just don’t know what is going on
with you. I know that may sound - Liz Yeah, we’ve been going on dates.
He seems like a nice guy. But come on, we’re going to be late. They walk
in together. Int. Community center, moments later Counselor Hey, I’m
Andy. I’ll be leading group today. Maggie Hi, Maggie. And that’s Liz.
She’s here to support me. Nice to meet you. COUNSELOR Have you been to a
meeting before? MAGGIE Nope. This is my first. CounSELOR Welcome. I’m
glad you’re here. What’s in the bottle? Maggie Water. COUNSELOR Cool.
Obviously no alcohol or drugs is permitted in meetings. Write your name
on one of these tags and take a seat anywhere. Maggie Thank you. Maggie
takes the name tag and writes “Maggie”. Her hands are shaking. Maggie
What if I can’t stay and do this, Liz? Liz You will. You know what’s
right. COUNSELOR Hi everyone, I am Andy, an alcoholic. I would like to
welcome you to the Monday evening Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. We would
like to give a special welcome to new attendees and have you introduce
yourselves. Caroline I’m Caroline. Cari I’m Cari. Maggie Maggie. Maggie
starts disassociating. Her hearing gets muffled, focus goes in and out.
INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, MOMENTS LATER Ultra wide, we can see the whole
circle. Full coverage of Mags. Counselor Does anyone that has been to
less than 15 meetings wanna speak? Someone raises their hand. Maggie is
petrified at the idea of speaking. Blaine Hi, my name is Blaine. I’m an
alcoholic. I’ve been sober for four days. I relapsed last week and have
been too ashamed to let anyone besides my sponsor know. I’m a mother of
two… I still consider myself a mother of two. I lost my child, my Anna,
six months and two days ago. And don’t get me wrong, I’ve always drank
too much. I’m embarrassed that I raised her drunk everyday. My husband
left me and got custody when she found out I drove her to school drunk
one morning. When I’m intoxicated, I feel fearless. When I’m sober I
feel terrified. Terrified of failure, rejection in the workplace,
interpersonal rejection, boredom. Because when I let the world go quiet
my brain screams. I can’t believe she’s gone. I can’t believe her mother
hates herself this much. I don’t know when I’m going to be able to
breathe again. Because right now, the weight is so heavy that I don’t
even want to live. I don’t want to be conscious. But I feel like to
honor her, and really support my son. I need to. So I’m on day four
today. And I feel like shit. But I’m proud to be here.<br />
Maggie looks at Michael, grabs her purse and gets up. She doesn’t think
she belongs here. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER, MOMENTS LATER Liz MAGS! Maggie
I don’t belong in there, Liz. Liz Why because you haven’t lost a kid?
Maggie Because I don’t have destructive behavior when I drink. Sometimes
I go too hard, sure I drink too much but I don’t think I need support
like that. Those people are on a different level than me. Liz I don’t
think they are. I think if you would go back inside you would relate to
what those people have to say. MAGGIE I’m sorry, I can’t pretend to be
something I’m not. Liz You already are. MAGGIE Fuck off, okay? Liz is
heart broken. Liz Wow. Yeah, I’ll go right on and fuck off on my three
hour drive back to my life in Joshua Tree. You’re welcome by the way.
MAGGIE Yeah, guilt me for asking for help. Really classy. Liz Just as
classy as leaving an AA meeting right after someone talks about their
dead kid. Good work. MAGGIE Whatever, I’ll see you when I see you.
Maybe. Liz Yeah, go and drink. I hope you enjoy your vodka bottle. Or
maybe this time you’ll get messed up on the flask? Oh if it’s a good day
you’ll do both at the same time. MAGGIE SHUT UP. (maggie throws her
water bottle on the ground) You walk around with insecurities leaking
off you and use anyone else’s short comings as ammo to ignore everything
wrong with you. Did you ever wonder why you can’t love someone? Why you
can’t get past the third date? Maybe because you don’t scratch the
surface on your bullshit. And trust me, as someone that’s unfortunately
known you for 16 years your issues are oceanic. A never ending abyss of
misery. Liz is floored. Liz Holy shit. Go drink. You’re easier to be
around. MAGGIE After this conversation, I could use one. Liz Of course
you could. Have a good life. Maggie I’d say the same, but honestly I
don’t give a fuck right now. Maggie storms off. She starts to pace to
get some of her anger out. She does this for a long while. Eventually,
sun light has shifted and the meeting ends. She realizes this and starts
walking to her car. Michael walks outside, hands in his pockets, looking
for Maggie. Michael Hey, I’m Michael. Was that your first meeting?
MAGGIE Yeah but, I don’t think I belong with y’all in there. No offense
at all. Michael I thought the same thing my first meeting. What’s the
substance? MAGGIE Alcohol. Michael How much a day? MAGGIE I don’t know…
Michael Yeah, okay. MAGGIE An average day… half a handle. Plus a bottle
of Bourbon and Rum a week. Michael And you don’t think that’s a problem?
Maggie doesn’t answer. Michael Give me your phone. MAGGIE I’m not really
looking for anything right now, I’m kind of a mess if you didn’t notice.
Michael Girl, I’m trying to be your friend. We support each other here.
MAGGIE I won’t be coming back. Michael Then don’t use the number. MAGGIE
That’s fair. What do you do? I feel like you should be a MAGGIE Lawyer.
Michael Lawyer. Yeah I know. Now imagine what it’s like dating me.
Maggie laughs. Michael Wanna go to a meeting later with me? MAGGIE Not
really, no. Michael smiles. Michael You’re funny. I hope you call. Good
luck, kid. MAGGIE I think we’re the same age.</p>
<p>Michael I’m 18 months sober, homie. You’re basically still in the
womb. Maggie rolls her eyes. Michael gets up and leaves Maggie alone in
the two shot. She looks alone. The fight with Liz starts to settle in.
INT. Bar, 1 hour later Maggie is sloshed. She orders a drink. Then
another. We see drink after drink being thrown down. She’s completely
gone. EXT. Bar parking lot, midnight It’s been hours and Maggie can
barely walk straight. She looks up a Lyft, but it’s too expensive. She
taps the top of her head, then rubs her stomach. Maggie Close enough.
She gets in the car, turns it on and starts to drive. Somehow she makes
it out of the parking lot. Driving down the road, she tries to make a
left turn and runs into a pole. We see police lights on a medium of
Maggie’s face. int. Michael Car, the next morning Michael is sitting in
his car, waiting for Maggie. He bailed her out. Maggie opens the car
door and sits down. Her eyes are puffy and red. She looks like shit.
Maggie I don’t have the money right now, but I’ll pay you back. Michael
I’ll make you a deal. If you’re ready to become sober, we call it even.
Maggie What? Michael My sponsor did it for me. Maggie Are you offering
to be my sponsor? Michael Are you looking for one? MAGGIE I could have
killed someone. Michael puts the car in reverse and starts driving.
Michael Yes you could have. MAGGIE I’m a horrible person. Michael No,
you’re a… MAGGIE I can’t. Michael You can. You look like you know it.
MAGGIE I can’t say it. Because then I have to deal with it. I have to
tell people, apologize to Liz, I have to reckon with my grief. It’s so
deep, man. It goes so deep and it hurts there. Michael I drowned my
grief with alcohol so I wouldn’t feel it. And guess what? It always came
back. Sometimes when I was drunk, my supposedly safe space. I think
about relapsing everyday, but you know what helps me not? The group is
the best community I’ve ever had. Do you have friends? A support system?
Maggie Not really, no. I push people away. Michael Me too. Want to be
friends? I could take another. Maggie I could use one. Michael You have
that woman you were with. MAGGIE Liz? I think I ruined that yesterday.
Michael “1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol — that our lives
had become unmanageable.” Maybe she’ll understand. MAGGIE I’m supposed
to make amends, right? Michael “9. Made direct amends to such people
wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.”
Maggie Except to injure them… I don’t know if I’m a good friend to her.
Michael An apology can come at anytime. Think on it. But probably not
for too long. Maggie smiles. MAGGIE Okay, yeah. I’ll think about it.
Michael pulls up the car at a diner. Maggie What are we doing here?
Michael Figured you could use a good meal. Maggie looks forward at the
diner. Maggie You have no idea how good that sounds. Michael opens his
door, Maggie follows. INT. Diner, 1 minute later Michael and Maggie are
sitting across from each other. Michael doesn’t open the menu, he
already knows what he wants. Maggie quickly looks, see’s the breakfast
platter and closes it. Waiter 2 What can I get you? Maggie The breakfast
platter and a black coffee. Can I add chocolate chips to the pancakes?
WAITER 2 Yes you can. MAGGIE Awesome, that would be great. Michael And
I’ll have the breakfast skillet with bacon, burnt. Waiter 2 Great, I’ll
have it right out. Maggie Thanks. Michael So what are you passionate
about? Maggie Damn, what a question… I’m a poet. I love writing and
performing my poems at Slams. Michael I’d love to hear a poem of yours.
MAGGIE Oh, I haven’t read my poems out loud in awhile. I haven’t been
able to write much for about a year. There was awhile where I was able
to support myself off of my poems - I wasn’t living the high life or
anything… but I was really proud of myself for that. Michael That’s
incredible. MAGGIE Thanks. Michael What happened? MAGGIE I started
drinking more. Again. I’ve had periods where I slowed down before.
Michael You ever quit? MAGGIE Yeah, but not with AA. I never thought I
was that bad. Michael Had to get in a car wreck to be shaken out of that
one, huh? MAGGIE Yeah, I guess so. Michael I hit someone on their bike.
MAGGIE Oh my gosh. Michael Luckily they were okay and didn’t press
charges. Small world, but the person was a student of my father’s when
he was younger. MAGGIE Your father was a teacher? Michael Senior English
Teacher. MAGGIE What made you want to be a lawyer? Michael I love to
talk. And research to debate. Law School was brutal though. Maggie Mmmm.
(she gets it) Thanks for having my back today. Michael You’re welcome.
Don’t do it again. You’re better than your addiction. MAGGIE Thank you.
You are too. (as if reasoning her own validity) You are too. The food
gets placed on the table. Waiter 2 exits frame. Two shot of them digging
in. INT. Community center, ONE MEETING LATER Maggie stands and receives
a coin for 24 hours of sobriety. INT. Maggie’s apartment, one hour later
Maggie cleans up alcohol bottles and trash. She picks up the Vodka
handle and considers throwing it out, but isn’t ready. She puts it in
the back of her pantry. INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER ULTRA
WIDE, PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT OUTFITS. Maggie isn’t
looking great. She’s going through with drawls. COUNSELOR Does anyone
that has been to less than 15 meetings wanna speak? There’s no way
Maggie could manage this. INT. MAGGIE’S APARTMENT, THAT EVENING Maggie
is throwing up in the toilet. She finishes, flushes and looks up “how
long do alcohol with-drawls last”. 24-72 hours. The doorbell rings.
Maggie goes to answer it. Maggie 24-48 hours more of this shit? Michael
enters the house and goes straight to the couch. He is comfortable here.
Michael SHE IS BEING BORN!! Welcome, kid. MAGGIE Talk more softly
please. Michael (whispering) Sorry. My favorite of the steps right now
is 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. Use
this pain to look into yourself. Don’t disassociate out of it. You’ll be
better off for it. Flashback to when Maggie was freaking out /
disassociating in her first meeting. She looked at Michael and he looked
at her. MAGGIE It’s like torture. And my heart feels like it’s being
squeezed by a hand of grief. Michael Powerful line there, I’m going to
text it to you for a potential poem. Hold on. Maggie I hate you. But
thank you. Maggie holds. We see how much pain she’s in. Michael Feel it
while you’re here, Mags. You owe yourself that. Maggie gets emotional.
She’s terrified. Maggie Okay. Maggie leans in to kiss Michael. He
immediately shifts away. Michael Maggie, that’s not why I’m here. I’m
your sponsor. I’m here to support you with your sobriety. MAGGIE I’m so
sorry, oh my god I can’t believe I just did that. Maggie is devastated.
Michael That’s okay. Really. Maggie I’m such an idiot, I can’t believe I
just did that. Michael You’re desperate to feel something. You miss the
high. MAGGIE I miss anything but the low right now. I don’t know if I
can do this. I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do handle this.
Michael You’ll come out of it. Now look, I came with a care package. He
hands Maggie a bag full of snacks and treats. Maggie You give me hope.
INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER ULTRA WIDE, PEOPLE ARE IN
DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT OUTFITS. Maggie is doing a bit better, but
still not great. INT. Maggie’S APARTMENT, THE NEXT DAY She throws out
the bottle of vodka and rum in the dumpster outside. Int. Maggie’s
apartment, the next day Maggie is in different clothes, working from
home as a telephone operator. She is writing in her journal, trying to
come up with new poems. Maggie “I have no map no holy book to explain
how all this happened. I didn’t mark this “X” and it doesn’t feel like
I’m winning treasure The stories of pirates always ended with getting
more. So why do I feel so hollow?” Her phone rings shortly after. Maggie
Hello there, this is Maggie. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with
today? EXT. Park, early morning, the next day Maggie is filling in 5
things she likes about herself. INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER
ULTRA WIDE, PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT OUTFITS. Counselor
Does anyone that has been to less than 15 meetings wanna speak? Maggie
feels uncomfortable. INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER DOLLY IS
PUSHING IN FROM THE WIDE. PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT
OUTFITS. COUNSELOR Does anyone that has been to less than 15 meetings
wanna speak? Maggie slumps in her seat. INT. MAGGIE’S APARTMENT, THE
NEXT DAY Maggie is making her bed and drinking coffee. INT. MAGGIE’S
CAR, LATER THAT DAY Maggie is listening to the phone ring. She’s call
Michael. Maggie is driving to the grocery store. MAGGIE It’s happening!
I’m going to the grocery store for the first time since being sober. And
I am not buying alcohol. And hopefully you’re free right now to just
chat while I’m in there.<br />
MICHAEL Wow, it was bound to happen. You can’t afford to keep getting
things delivered. MAGGIE Really good pump up, sponsor. Thanks. MICHAEL
You’re doing great and I’m absolutely available. MAGGIE Much better
thank you. MICHAEL You’re so welcome. MAGGIE So I picked up a kids meal
today, and I tried to give the toy to a kid. But, this six year old girl
shook her pointer finger at me and said “Nuhuh. No.” MICHAEL I think
it’s great that she can assert her boundaries and wants at a young age.
That’s a challenging trait to build! MAGGIE Okay, don’t take her side.
MICHAEL You’re so right. That six year old sucks. What was she even
thinking? Gosh. MAGGIE There we gooooo. Maggie turns off the car. MAGGIE
Okay I’m going in. INT. MAGGIE’S APARTMENT, THE NEXT DAY Michael and
Maggie are sitting comfortably on the couch. They each have a sparkling
water. MAGGIE Okay, okay. What about lakes or pools? MICHAEL They are so
different… MAGGIE But still a large body of water that -in this case-
you can swim in. MICHAEL I can’t have a boat in a pool. MAGGIE But you
can have a really cute floaty. MICHAEL That’s true, that’s true. Lake.
You? MAGGIE Lake. I can’t believe it took you that long. MICHAEL Fair
enough. They both smile. INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER DOLLY
IS PUSHING IN FROM THE WIDE + WILL LAND IN A MEDIUM. PEOPLE ARE IN
DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT OUTFITS. COUNSELOR Does anyone with over a
year want to speak? Michael I do. CounSELOR Go ahead. In a medium on
Michael and Maggie. Michael Hi, I’m Michael. I’m an alcoholic. I used to
drink half a handle of vodka before noon. I stopped nineteen months ago,
and I thought I would feel stronger than I do. I feel like shit. And so
ashamed. I can apologize to others, follow the steps but the want is
still there to escape, to drink. And I’m so ashamed of that. And of all
the pain I’ve ensued on those that I love. I guess I just want to say
I’m struggling. In hopes that saying it, knowing you all know, will help
me not relapse. Because right now, I really want to. CounSELOR Thank you
for sharing. I think it’s safe to say, everyone here can relate. People
nod. Counselor We are here to support you in the journey. And your
sponsor is there for moments like these. Have you reached out to them?
Michael No, I haven’t. COUNSELOR We need to lean on one another in times
where we don’t feel our strength. If we don’t reach out to others, how
will they feel safe to lean on us? Maggie stares at Michael. She feels
seen. CounSELOR Anyone else want to share? Maggie sinks in her seat.
EXT. SIDE WALK, LATER THAT DAY Maggie is going on a run. Int. CommUNITY
CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER CouNSELOR “5. Admitted to God, to ourselves,
and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.” Maggie
thinks this over. EXT. COMMUNITY CENTER, After meeting Maggie is walking
to her car when she stops in the spot where she was standing in her and
Liz’s fight. She remembers what she said, takes a deep breath and calls
Liz. Liz picks up. Liz Hello? Maggie Hey, I’m going to just rant about
where I’m at so you realize I’m actively changing. Is that okay? Liz Hit
it. MAGGIE I’ve been going to AA. I’ve been sober for 7 days. I’m so
sorry for how I spoke to you in our fight. You were trying to help me
and be a good friend. I didn’t even wake up from our fight, I drunk
drove and hit a pole that night. I got arressted and bailed out by my
sponsor. I’ve been going to AA everyday and the community is really
helping me. I miss you and hope that you can forgive me. I want to stay
sober. I don’t want to be the person that drinks and drives, or yells at
her best friend. I was an asshole. I feel horrible and you deserve
better. LIZ I missed you. Welcome back, Mags. MAGGIE How are you doing?
How’s Joshua Tree? LIZ I’m doing really well. Work is whatever, I love
Joshua Tree, I’ve been hiking a ton, I’m still seeing Dan and he’s
introduced me to a lot of really great friends here. How has writing
been? MAGGIE It’s actually a bit better. I feel like because I’m
processing life more, I’m able to write about it in my work. I feel
scared, awake and alert. It’s like a breath of fresh air-well… in the
easy moments, that is. LIZ Oh MY GOSH I’VE MISSED YOU. MAGGIE Thank you
for trying to forgive me. LIZ You’re so welcome. MAGGIE Alright, I’d
love to talk again soon. Liz Me too. Love you mean it. Maggie Love you
say it back. Liz Oh! I love you. Int. Liz’s House, one moment later Liz
I think that went really well. Dan It seemed like it! What did she say??
EXT. Community center, moments later Maggie hangs up the phone and takes
a moment to herself. Which gets disrupted by… Michael MAGS! Diner? She
laughs. Maggie Yeah, you drive. Maggie exits frame. Maggie You’ll never
guess what I just did… Michael You called Liz? MAGGIE How the hell did
you guess that? MICHAEL We were just talking about it! MAGGIE But you
stole my thunder. MICHAEL Hold up, let’s roll it back. He walks
backwards, she laughs, then does the same. Maggie You’ll never guess
what I just did! MICHAEL I have no idea, what is it? MAGGIE (she gives
him a look) I called Liz, apologized and she accepted my apology.
Michael puts his hands on top of the car as he looks at Maggie. This
stops her. MICHAEL I’m so proud of you. This affects Maggie. MAGGIE
Thank you. That’s really nice to hear. He starts to open his door, then
stops. Michaels Mags… I need to tell you something. MAGGIE Okay.
MICHAELS I can’t be your sponsor anymore. But I want us to stay in each
other’s lives. Maggie What?? Michael I will still be here to support
you, and I’ll help you through the process of finding someone new.
MAGGIE Why? MICHAEL I don’t want to talk about it, but it’s a me thing.
Just try and trust me, okay? MAGGIE I trust you. But I need you,
Michael. Michael I’m not leaving you, Mags. I’m just not being your
sponsor. Maggie Okay… you know, I lost my appetite. I’m sorry, I’m going
to see my Grandpa in an hour anyway. Just let me process this. Michael I
get it. Call when you want to talk. INT. GRANDPA’S HOUSE, EARLY EVENING
Maggie sits, similarly slumped, on the couch waiting as her Grandfather
brings a bowl of popcorn and roasted peanuts to the coffee table. Maggie
I want to tell you something, Grandpa. Grandpa Do you need money? MAGGIE
What? No, I – GRANDPA Have a boyfriend? MAGGIE GRANDPA. Give me a
second. This is hard to share. GraNDPA No jokes right now, got it.
MAGGIE Thank you. I’m an alcoholic. GRANDPA What? MAGGIE I started
drinking when I was 14 when Grandma died. At first it was just a little,
then I started drinking every morning before school to help my anxiety.
Then I started having two drinks before school and filling my water
bottle with Vodka. I think I mastered the art of drinking enough to be
drunk inconspicuously. Until recently. I was mean to a good friend,
drunk drove and got in an accident. Luckily no one was hurt. I’ve been
going to AA and, well, I had a sponsor. I want to apologize for not
being honest with you. Beat. GRANDPA Wow. I never would have guessed.
Are you drunk now? Maggie No, Grandpa. I’ve been going to AA. And I was
finally able to write the other day. I think it’s because of it. Grandpa
Will you read it to me? MAGGIE Always. It’s called Heart Drops.</p>
<p>“The bathtub takes time to fill Drip Drops Rome wasn’t built in a day
but in a flash of a moment, a single blink the stopper disappears the
water is slipping through the finger tips Down my throat I’m treading
through nothingness left to be empty Rome wasn’t built in a day But it
sure can be destroyed in one.” GRANDPA I should have seen something.
What can I do to help? MAGGIE I don’t know. Try and forgive me for
lying. For throwing school down the drain and having a DUI. Am I a
disappointment to you? Grandpa Are you kidding? I’m always proud of you.
Face your demons, kid. They’ll never go away until you face them. MAGGIE
What if I can’t conquer them? GRANDPA You will. You’re the bravest
person I know. MAGGIE I don’t feel brave. Grandpa Well, you are. It’s
evident to anyone that knows you. You’ve always been fearless. MAGGIE
I’ve always been petrified. GRANDPA Then you hide it well. And maybe you
shouldn’t. Maybe you should talk about it more. Talking about your
fears, or loving yourself more, doesn’t make you scared, it makes you
brave. Maggie digests this. Maggie You told me to love myself more
awhile ago too… Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe I don’t love myself
enough. GRANDPA I don’t know why you wouldn’t love yourself. But if you
don’t, it seems like now is the best time to start. Take the void of the
alcohol and fill it with love for yourself. Maybe you can write five
things you like about yourself a day. Here - He gets up and grabs her a
piece of paper and a pen. grandpa I’m ordering us pepperoni and jalapeño
pizza. You deserve it. Maggie looks at him with fear. GRANDPA What?
Maggie I don’t know what to write. Grandpa You’re a great writer. One.
You fill in the rest. Grandpa exits to order some pizza. Maggie stares
down at the paper and writes “5 things I like about myself. 1. I’m a
great writer”. She pauses and tries to think… she gets emotional at her
inability to find something. “2. My …” Suddenly she hears her
grandfather screaming into the telephone. Grandpa (v.o.) HELLO! Can I
order a large pepperoni and jalapeño pizza to be delivered? (beat) HUH?
Can you talk louder? Stupid phone. We were better off without them.
Maggie releases a small laugh, looks down at the paper and writes “my
hands are pretty. 3.” Cut to wide of her writing things she likes about
herself. INT. COMMUNITY CENTER, ONE MEETING LATER DOLLY STARTS WIDE AND
WILL LAND IN A CLOSE UP. Maggie is in the same area of the frame as the
previous wide. PEOPLE ARE IN DIFFERENT SPOTS, DIFFERENT OUTFITS.
COUNSELOR Does anyone that has been to less than 15 meetings wanna
speak? Maggie I’ll say something. Where do I start? I’m feeling nervous.
CouNSELOR How long have you been sober? MAGGIE I had four days and
relapsed. I’m on nine. I usually drink everyday. Most of the day. In my
water bottle. (realizing) Not today! I wouldn’t do that here. A beat.
COUNSELOR You can just share what you’re thinking about today. MAGGIE
Today is my thirty day, and the anniversary of my Grandma’s passing. She
was a best friend, a role model of mine. I miss her so much, it hurts. I
feel like I just haven’t recouped. Some people are just special. She
changed people’s lives. Actually.</p>
<p>It’s strange when I think about my Grandpa passing. I selfishly want
him alive so badly, but there’s also an ease in digesting the
information, the loss. Because he’s lived a long life. Someone younger,
like my Grandma, I have felt more of an ache. A pain.</p>
<p>I have a lot of stomach issues and I think it’s because I struggle to
digest. Because how can you? Just accepting that “it is what it is”, I
suppose. My grandma said that. I live by it. She changed my life. I
avoid things that hurt with alcohol. Like talking about how she changed
people’s lives. I was trying to express how much she affected me. And
despite having been gone 9 years ago today, she still is my role model.
Drinking makes it easier and without that outlet I feel like I’m going
to explode with grief.</p>
<p>When I’m drinking I keep everything together. I don’t party too hard,
it’s like a slow burn. And is that really so bad? Everyone’s addicted to
something, right? Couneselor You deserve to be present in your life.
Maggie Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I feel like I have to live a good life to
honor her. I don’t fully know why that is. Maybe to make her proud?
COUNSELOR Are you living a good life? Maggie looks at the counselor.
Then away. She thinks. She knows she isn’t. But this is the first step.
She wants to take it. MAGGIE No, I don’t think so. I feel like a broken
person. But I want to live a good life. I want to live a better life
than this. I’ve never had many friends… one great one and that’s it. I
push others away because I don’t think I ever loved myself… I’m trying
this thing where I write down five things I love about myself a day and
at first it was really hard, but as I notice more and more about myself,
I notice more I can love. I’m embarrassed to say how scared I feel to be
happy. Because if I’m happy, if I heal from the loss of my grandmother,
if I keep not drinking, how will I fill my time? With myself, with
others, with my work. Hopefully, with love. I hope that’s what’s waiting
for me on the other side of a this. I think I’m ready to be happy. INT.
Community Center, Hallway, Post-Meeting Maggie is walking out. Michael
catches up to her. Michael Maggie! Maggie Hey MICHAEL I know we aren’t
talking right now, but I just wanted to say that was incredible. You
were just so honest and vulnerable. That takes a lot of bravery. Thank
you for sharing. MAGGIE (touched) Thanks, Michael. That means a lot.
MICHAEL Do you want to talk? MAGGIE Yeah, wanna come to my place?
MICHAEL Yeah, I’ll meet you there. They both try and cross frame, but
run into each other. You see a glimpse of nervousness between them.
MAGGIE My bad. MICHAEL Sorry about that. They pause. She motions for him
to go and he does. She processes how much she missed him. INT. Maggie’s
apartment, living room, that night Michael and Maggie are sitting
comfortably on the couch. They each have a sparkling water. Maggie I
think I’m gunna read at a poetry slam. MICHAEL Can people go? MAGGIE
Yeah, Liz and her boyfriend are actually coming in for it from Joshua
Tree. It’s tomorrow night. MICHAEL I’d love to go, if you’d be open to
me being there. Beat. Maggie Why couldn’t you be my sponsor anymore?
Michael considers whether or not to say… then, MICHAEL I have feelings
for you, Maggie. I can’t be a good sponsor to you when I feel this way.
A defense mechanism… MAGGIE I… I don’t think I’m in a good place right
now for a relationship. I’ve been sober for one month and am scared I’m
going to fall back. MICHAEL That’s okay. They sit in silence. A deep
breath in. Maggie But I’m interested. MICHAEL Yeah? MAGGIE Yeah. But I
don’t know when I’ll be ready. Michael That’s okay. MAGGIE Okay, cool.
Until we talk about it again…. can we just be friends? (underplaying in
delivery) I don’t want to lose you. Michael Yes, of course, you crazy
person. But I can’t pretend to be something I’m not with you. You
deserve better than that. MAGGIE Thank you. That’s so kind. MICHAEL It’s
just honest. Maggie I’d love for you to come to the Slam. INT. Home
living room / theatre space, poety slam, evening The tapping of Maggie’s
foot in a dark and loud room. Maggie, Michael, Liz and Dan sit at a
poetry slam. Host (v.O.) Hey everyone welcome to this weeks Poetry Slam.
As always, we pull readers from a bowl. Tonight’s poet order is as
follows… Maggie Monroe, Catie Alverez, Bianca Ramearro and Abby
Rustin.<br />
Maggie and Liz have a silent moment of celebration. Host Introducing,
Maggie! Maggie Hi everyone, my name is Maggie. It’s my first slam in
about a year. I’m really happy to be here. Liz (yelling from the
audience) GET IT GIRL! MAGGIE It’s called Desert(ion). “I am slipping
between my finger tips like water, this journey of 12 steps rushing up
my body never finding my mind. She who seeks shall find. So I trek
through my days in deserts, of oceanic flows of foggy overlooks and I
Open my heart and take it all, I pray Release me of these hot flashes
these visions that replay when I beg differently Visions of fear that
you say is the Devil. Well, no shit because it is hotter than hell here.
Coverage of Mag’s loved ones. medium, observation shots. Maggie You tell
me that if I can’t stand the heat to get out of the kitchen I didn’t
know thats where this led me but I need to eat so feed me? nourish me
and take me back to days of slumber- fuzzy blankets and cuddles mid-day
spiders that were friends and imaginations that ran free Ran to places
of fairytales and always re-reading me stories that took me too long to
understand. You told me to stop with coloring books because I was too
old To free myself of the confines of someone else’s imagination, but
what if I have found myself trapped in my own Images of him leaving
visions of the heat becoming too much of walking into the light and
feeling the cool on my face for the first time in 16 years. What if you
took my hand, invited me to your new home and let me color in books
again because we got to start over. What if you gave me light. Created
wind to defeat the fire that is reaching up my face and into each pore
that is supposed to be protecting something greater. How many steps can
I take without knowing the end point? * The end point is where I declare
it. Take a deep breath and release the heat back to where it came from,
they say… Play with the sand between my toes and make the heat my
friend. Inhale they say, I cough out the golden dust all around me “Keep
treking,” they respond. Let go of the sand, hold onto the moment.” Thank
you.</p>
