## February 28th, 2023

Travelling to a new place for the first time can be both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. Especially when it's outside of your comfort zone. I recently had the opportunity to travel to Madrid, Spain for a week, which marked my first international trip outside of North America. And let me tell you, it was an experience I will never forget.

Madrid is a vibrant city filled with history, art, culture, and amazing food. The city is a mix of old and new, with beautiful architecture that has stood the test of time. One of the first things that struck me about Madrid was the warmth of the people. From the airport to the streets, everyone was friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home.

As I explored the city, I found myself constantly in awe of the stunning buildings, monuments, and parks. The Royal Palace of Madrid, with its intricate details and grandeur, was one of my favorite sights. Walking through the Puerta del Sol, one of the busiest squares in Madrid, I felt like I was part of the hustle and bustle of city life.

But what I enjoyed most about Madrid was its food culture. From tapas to paella, Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its bold flavors and deliciousness. I visited many local restaurants and cafes, trying everything from traditional Spanish dishes to fusion cuisine. My personal favorite was a small tapas bar in the Malasa√±a neighborhood that served the most amazing patatas bravas I have ever tasted.

One of the biggest challenges I faced during my trip was the language barrier. Although many people in Madrid speak English, it was still difficult at times to communicate effectively. However, I quickly learned that a smile and a willingness to try to speak Spanish went a long way in breaking down barriers and building connections with the locals.

In conclusion, my first international trip to Madrid was a life-changing experience. It opened my eyes to a new culture, language, and way of life. It taught me to be more adventurous and open-minded, and to embrace new experiences with enthusiasm. I can't wait to plan my next international adventure and see what other exciting opportunities await.

Also, I just thought of a littlebit more to add to this...

Certainly, working remotely while traveling can be a unique experience, and Madrid was no exception. Despite the time difference, I was able to maintain my work schedule in the Pacific Time Zone while enjoying everything the city had to offer.

One of the perks of working remotely while traveling is the flexibility it provides. I could explore the city during the day, try different foods, and visit museums and landmarks, all while still being able to attend virtual meetings and complete my work tasks.

Working remotely also allowed me to immerse myself more fully in the local culture. I visited local cafes and co-working spaces, where I had the opportunity to meet locals and other travelers who were also working remotely. It was interesting to learn about their experiences and how they balanced work and travel.

Overall, working remotely in Madrid was a great experience. It gave me the freedom to travel and explore a new city while also staying on top of my work responsibilities. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to do so.
