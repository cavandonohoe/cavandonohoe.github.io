<h2>2022</h2>
<div id="week-of-may-16th-2022" class="section level3">
<h3>Week of May 16th, 2022</h3>
<p>Travelling to a new place for the first time can be both exhilarating
and nerve-wracking. Especially when it’s outside of your comfort zone. I
recently had the opportunity to travel to Madrid, Spain for a week,
which marked my first international trip outside of North America. And
let me tell you, it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>Madrid is a vibrant city filled with history, art, culture, and
amazing food. The city is a mix of old and new, with beautiful
architecture that has stood the test of time. One of the first things
that struck me about Madrid was the warmth of the people. From the
airport to the streets, everyone was friendly and welcoming, making me
feel right at home.</p>
<p>As I explored the city, I found myself constantly in awe of the
stunning buildings, monuments, and parks. The Royal Palace of Madrid,
with its intricate details and grandeur, was one of my favorite sights.
Walking through the Puerta del Sol, one of the busiest squares in
Madrid, I felt like I was part of the hustle and bustle of city
life.</p>
<p>But what I enjoyed most about Madrid was its food culture. From tapas
to paella, Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its bold flavors and
deliciousness. I visited many local restaurants and cafes, trying
everything from traditional Spanish dishes to fusion cuisine. My
personal favorite was a small tapas bar in the Malasaña neighborhood
that served the most amazing patatas bravas I have ever tasted. And some
dank sangria!</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during my trip was the language
barrier. Although many people in Madrid speak English, it was still
difficult at times to communicate effectively. However, I quickly
learned that a smile and a willingness to try to speak Spanish went a
long way in breaking down barriers and building connections with the
locals. Plus, Google Translate was super effective with ordering food
and what not. Also, in a lot of places in Europe, they won’t come around
with the bill, so you’ll actually have to get the courage to ask
them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my first international trip to Madrid was a
life-changing experience. It opened my eyes to a new culture, language,
and way of life. It taught me to be more adventurous and open-minded,
and to embrace new experiences with enthusiasm. I can’t wait to plan my
next international adventure and see what other exciting opportunities
await.</p>
<p>Also, I just thought of a little bit more to add to this…</p>
<p>Certainly, working remotely while traveling can be a unique
experience, and Madrid was no exception. Despite the time difference, I
was able to maintain my work schedule in the Pacific Time Zone while
enjoying everything the city had to offer. So my schedule ended up being
a fun period of exploring whichever city I was in from 10am - 6pm, work
from 6pm - 2am, then sleep from 2am - 10am. Then repeat :D</p>
<p>One of the perks of working remotely while traveling is the
flexibility it provides. I could explore the city during the day, try
different foods, and visit museums and landmarks, all while still being
able to attend virtual meetings and complete my work tasks.</p>
<p>Working remotely also allowed me to immerse myself more fully in the
local culture. I visited local cafes and co-working spaces, where I had
the opportunity to meet locals and other travelers who were also working
remotely. It was interesting to learn about their experiences and how
they balanced work and travel.</p>
<p>Overall, working remotely in Madrid was a great experience. It gave
me the freedom to travel and explore a new city while also staying on
top of my work responsibilities. I would highly recommend it to anyone
who has the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>To get real for a sec: This was a good start to the trip. I started
walking a bunch and really enjoyed seeing everyone else there. It was
pretty warm there and there wasn’t great water in the Airbnb butttt it
was really awesome going to the nearby square (plaza) to get more water.
And people were there till I was done working at 2am. I should have
struck up a conversation with some random people over there. Oh well,
missed opportunity.</p>

<h3>Week of May 23rd, 2022</h3>
<p>Biking the Amalfi Coast is one of the most iconic experiences in
Italy. The stunning coastal views, charming towns, and delicious food
make it a must-see destination for any traveler. But what happens when
you rent an electric bike and are too proud to use the electric part?
That’s exactly what happened to me during my trip to Naples, Italy.</p>
<p>After spending a week in Madrid, I was ready for my next adventure. I
decided to visit Naples and rent an electric bike to explore the Amalfi
Coast. However, when I picked up the bike, I forgot to turn on the
electric assist. As a result, I was left with a heavy bike that was
difficult to pedal, especially on the steep hills of the Amalfi
Coast.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging start, I decided to embrace the experience
and set off on my adventure. I took a train to Salerno, a town at the
southern end of the Amalfi Coast, and started my bike ride along the
winding roads that hug the coastline.</p>
<p>The views were breathtaking. The turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian
Sea sparkled in the sunlight, and the colorful houses perched on the
hillsides added to the charm of the towns. However, as the day went on,
I began to feel the strain of pedaling a heavy bike uphill.</p>
<p>At times, I had to slow down and catch my breath but never ever push
my bike. It was actually impossible to walk with a bike on the windy
streets of the Amalfi Coast just because the streets were so narrow. It
was exhausting though. But with each turn, the stunning views made it
all worth it. I passed through charming towns like Vietri sul Mare,
Amalfi, and Positano, each with its unique character and beauty.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, I reached the end of my bike ride and
arrived back in Sorrento. However, the adventure wasn’t quite over. When
I tried to take the bike on the train back to Naples, I was told that I
couldn’t because of the size of the bike. I had to pedal the entire way
back to Naples, which was challenging, but also a fitting end to the
day’s adventure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, biking the Amalfi Coast on a heavy bike was a unique
experience. While it was challenging at times, it was also incredibly
rewarding. The stunning views, charming towns, and sense of
accomplishment made it a trip I will never forget. It reminded me that
sometimes, the most memorable experiences come from stepping out of your
comfort zone and embracing the journey, even if it doesn’t go as
planned.</p>
<p>This trip also featured Janella and Becky who made the trip so much
better. I realized how nice it was to have a balance of seeing friends
and also doing my own thing. It does get lonely if it’s just me doing my
own thing days on end. But then again, you’d think I’d get lonely on
that massive 75 mile bike ride along the Amalfi Coast. But for some
reason, that felt great. This form of long term traveling seems to get
me to learn more and more about myself.</p>

<h3>May 30th - June 19th 2022</h3>
<p>Rome is one of the most vibrant and historic cities in the world, and
I had the opportunity to explore it for three weeks. During my trip, I
stayed at my friend Mauro’s place, watched the 2022 FIVB World Tour
Finals tournament, and had an amazing time. I also got to hangout with
Shannon Costa and got to meet some of my favorite volleyball players in
the world! Mauro was only there for one week too! It’s very funny
because he was only there for one week, while I was there for 3…</p>
<p>One of the best things about staying with a local is that you get a
unique perspective on the city. Mauro was a great host, showing me the
hidden gems of Rome that are often overlooked by tourists. We had some
truly authentic Italian food and he showed me things my tongue only
dreamed about. Like in a non sexual way. It was a great way to immerse
myself in the local culture and get a true taste of Rome.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was attending the 2022 FIVB World
Tour Finals tournament. The tournament featured some of the best
volleyball players in the world, and the matches were intense and
exciting. I got to see top teams from around the world compete, and the
atmosphere in the stadium was electric. I got to meet a bunch of
Norwegians who offered me to let them stay with them up in Oslo! So I’ll
be going in the summer of 2023 to see if they’re still down for
that.</p>
<p>Apart from the volleyball tournament, there was so much to see and do
in Rome. I visited famous landmarks like the Colosseum, the Vatican, and
the Pantheon, and each one was more impressive than the last. The
history and art in Rome are breathtaking, and it’s incredible to think
about the stories that each monument and building holds.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed wandering around the city, getting lost in the narrow
streets and stumbling upon hidden treasures. Rome is a city that rewards
exploration, and I loved discovering new places and experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, no trip to Rome is complete without trying the food. From
pizza and pasta to gelato and espresso, every meal was a culinary
adventure. Mauro took me to his favorite local spots, where we indulged
in delicious dishes and soaked up the atmosphere. And let me tell you
the carbonara was so so so good!! I still dream of that pasta dish to
this day.</p>
<p>Overall, my three weeks in Rome were a fantastic experience. Staying
with a local gave me a unique perspective on the city, and the FIVB
tournament added an extra layer of excitement. Rome is a city that has
so much to offer, from its history and culture to its food and
nightlife. It’s a place that I will always hold dear to my heart, and I
can’t wait to go back and explore more.</p>
<p>One last thing btw… There is a spot in Rome called Yellow Door Hostel
Bar that was so incredible! I went only twice, but I had the best time
ever! If I wasn’t staying on the other side of town, I would have gone
more often. I met so many friendly faces there! And every time I went,
there were hardly any outdoor spots to sit, so you would have to share a
table with other people there. Which ends up building some long term
relationships with these people. And everyone spoke English too which
was huge!</p>

<h3>Week of June 20th</h3>
<p>Dubrovnik is a picturesque city located on the Adriatic coast of
Croatia. It’s known for its stunning medieval architecture, charming
streets, and crystal-clear waters. I had the opportunity to explore this
beautiful city for a week, and it was an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>One of the things that stood out to me about Dubrovnik was its
history. The city has been around for centuries and has gone through
many transformations over the years. I had the chance to walk along the
ancient city walls and admire the stunning views of the red-tiled roofs
and the sparkling sea. It was fascinating to see how the city has
evolved over the centuries, and I felt like I was stepping back in
time.</p>
<p>Another highlight of my trip was exploring the Old Town. The
cobblestone streets, stone buildings, and charming squares were like
something out of a fairy tale. I spent hours wandering through the
narrow alleys and admiring the architecture. The city is so well
preserved that it’s easy to imagine what life was like in the past. I
felt like Hulk in Endgame… SO MANY STAIRS. I got a nice butt workout
from this experience. It was really hot there too, so I was a sweaty
mess.</p>
<p>Of course, no trip to Dubrovnik is complete without spending time by
the sea. The beaches and coves in Dubrovnik are some of the most
beautiful I’ve ever seen. I spent several afternoons swimming in the
clear water and sunbathing on the rocky beaches. It was a wonderful way
to relax and take in the natural beauty of the city.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Dubrovnik was an amazing adventure. The city is
full of history, culture, and natural beauty. I loved exploring the Old
Town, swimming in the sea, and trying the delicious food. It’s a place
that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and
unforgettable travel experience.</p>
<p>I mean and living in King’s Landing for a week was dope too. I was
just listing to the theme music for hours on end. I recommend walking
along the wall in the Old City. Best walk around the city I’ve had! Plus
you’re up so high without any railings, so that’s a thrill too.</p>
<p>I stayed in an Airbnb in the Port of Dubrovnik, so I got to see a
beautiful view from my pad every day while I worked over there.</p>

<h3>Weekend of June 25th</h3>
<p>Zagreb is the capital of Croatia and a vibrant city with a rich
history and culture. I had the opportunity to explore this charming city
for a weekend and it was a fantastic experience. I also took a quick
visit to Plitvice Lakes National Park, which was a highlight of my
trip.</p>
<p>Zagreb has a fascinating history that’s reflected in its architecture
and culture. The city is a blend of medieval and modern, with colorful
buildings, narrow streets, and spacious parks. I spent most of my time
wandering around the streets and exploring the local markets. The city
has a lively atmosphere with street musicians, cafes, and bars. It was a
great place to soak up the local culture.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the Plitvice Lakes
National Park. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the
most beautiful natural wonders of Croatia. The park features a series of
cascading waterfalls, crystal-clear lakes, and lush green forests. I
spent several hours hiking around the park and admiring the stunning
scenery. It was a peaceful and magical experience that left me in awe. I
took a picture of a waterfall while I was on a waterfall!!</p>
<p>Back in Zagreb, I enjoyed trying the local cuisine. Croatian food is
delicious and diverse, with influences from Italy, Austria, and the
Balkans. I tried traditional dishes like grilled meats, seafood, and
pasta, and I also enjoyed the local wines and spirits. The local markets
are also a great place to sample fresh fruits, vegetables, and
cheeses.</p>
<p>Overall, my weekend trip to Zagreb with a quick visit to Plitvice was
a wonderful adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and great
food. Plitvice Lakes National Park was a stunning natural wonder that
left me breathless. It’s a place that I would highly recommend to anyone
looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience.</p>
<p>Also, I got to hostel with Janella! And that was a blast! What a fun
time with a fun person! And I stayed in my very first hostel and got to
experience that type of craziness and cool people!</p>
<p>Oh btw, on my way to Plitvice I missed my bus stop so I got off and
started walking back towards Plitvice and ended up getting a ride from a
nice stranger. And I didn’t get murdered! Hurray!</p>

<h3>Week of June 27th</h3>
<p>Split is a charming coastal city located in southern Croatia. It’s
known for its beautiful beaches, stunning architecture, and vibrant
nightlife (of which I didn’t partake since I am not huge into loud
clubs). I had the opportunity to explore this wonderful city for a week,
and it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip to Split was exploring the historic
Old Town. The city is over 1,700 years old, and it’s packed with
incredible sights and sounds. I spent hours wandering through the narrow
streets, admiring the beautiful architecture, and exploring the local
markets. One of the must-see sights in Split is the Diocletian’s Palace,
which was built in the 4th century and is now a UNESCO World Heritage
Site.</p>
<p>Another highlight of my trip was the local cuisine. Croatian food is
delicious and diverse, and Split is a great place to sample it. I tried
traditional dishes like grilled fish and meat, fresh seafood, and pasta.
I also enjoyed the local wines and spirits, which added to the
experience.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Split was a fantastic adventure. The city is full
of history, culture, and natural beauty. I loved exploring the Old Town,
trying the delicious food, and spending time by the sea. The vibrant
nightlife was also a highlight of my trip. It’s a place that I would
highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>Another round of hitting the hostel in this town too! I had a fun
little time over there exploring the city on the last few days with
Janella again!</p>
</div>
<div id="weekend-of-july-1st" class="section level3">
<h3>Weekend of July 1st</h3>
<p>So this was a crazy weekend. It started on a delayed flight from
Split to Milan. Then I took a train over to Como to see how beautiful
the lake was over there and also to go to that mansion where Attack of
the Clones was filmed. Butttt I didn’t have time because I needed to
make a bus from Milan to Nice. And I ended up missing my bus anyways
because of train delays! I was so close to making it too! Oh well. I
payed for an overpriced bus ticket to get from Milan to Nice with a stop
in Lyon. But the stop in Lyon was excellent! I had an amazing macaron
and an amazing croissant! I dream about that! Omg!</p>
<p>Anyways, I ended up making it to Nice with very little sleep on that
bus ride, but hey… I made it.</p>
<p>Nice is a beautiful coastal city located in the south of France. It’s
known for its stunning beaches, colorful buildings, and vibrant culture.
I had the opportunity to explore this charming city for a weekend with
Daphney, and it was an incredible experience. I also had the chance to
meet two fun guys from Miami who offered to take me on a day trip to
Monaco since. Part of the fun of these trips is getting to meet new
people and it is so easy to meet new people when I am with a fun person
on that trip. So thank you, Daphney for making it easy to make friends
with these people.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Nice was the beautiful
architecture. The city is full of colorful buildings, narrow streets,
and quaint cafes. I spent most of my time exploring the local markets,
trying the delicious food, and soaking up the local culture. Nice has a
lively atmosphere with street performers, musicians, and artists. It was
a great place to relax and take in the local scenery.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was meeting the two guys at my
Airbnb who invited me to join them on a day trip to Monaco. They had a
cabana at this club overlooking the sea on one side and the speedway
track on the other and offered to take me along for free. It was an
incredible experience. We spent the day swimming in the pool and
pretending to be rich. We met other people who were probably doing the
same exact thing. Monaco is a stunning city with luxurious buildings and
beautiful scenery. We visited the famous Monte Carlo casino and enjoyed
the local shops and restaurants. It was a great day and one that I will
never forget.</p>
<p>Back in Nice, I also spent the evening hiking up to the castle at the
top of the hill. I find all of France just has an atmosphere of
romanticism. I loved seeing the lights at night and all of the beauty of
the city from above.</p>
<p>Sidenote: I’m an idiot for not having ratatouille in France…</p>
<p>Overall, my weekend trip to Nice with a day trip to Monaco was a
fantastic adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and natural
beauty. The local cuisine was delicious, and the beaches were stunning.
The chance encounter with the two fun guys from Miami who took me to
Monaco was a highlight of my trip. It’s a place that I would highly
recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>Also, the beaches are pebbly beaches, so I recommend sandals or
shoes. So watch out for that.</p>

<h3>Week of July 4th</h3>
<p>Happy Independence Day! First one I have experienced being away from
the US.</p>
<p>Marseille is a beautiful city located in the south of France. It’s
known for its stunning coastline, historic landmarks, and vibrant
culture. I had the opportunity to spend a week exploring this charming
city and even took a day trip to Paris.</p>
<p>Marseille has a rich history and a unique culture. The city is full
of historic landmarks, including the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde, a
beautiful basilica perched on a hill overlooking the city. I also
visited the Old Port, a bustling area filled with restaurants, cafes,
and shops. The locals are friendly and welcoming, and I enjoyed chatting
with them and learning more about their way of life.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was a day trip to Paris. It’s only a
three-hour train ride from Marseille, so it was easy to take a day trip.
I visited some of the most famous landmarks in Paris, including the
Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. It was a busy
day, but I managed to see a lot of the city in a short amount of time.
And Phoebe Hung let me stay at her place and also play tour guide to the
city she was living in for the summer! Crazy enough was I never actually
had a real conversation with Phoebe until Paris and then we ended up
talking for 8 hours! That was crazy!</p>
<p>Back in Marseille, I spent time exploring the local beaches. But
really just one beach in particular. I am too lazy right now to look it
up, but I played so much volleyball with the locals over there! Just by
saying I played volleyball in California, they automatically took me in
and saw me as an expert (even though I have been playing for 16 years, I
still don’t consider myself an expert). But hey, I played with some
French people and that was a fun time!</p>
<p>The local cuisine was another highlight of my trip. Marseille is
famous for its seafood, and I enjoyed some of the freshest and most
delicious seafood I’ve ever had. I also tried traditional dishes like
bouillabaisse, a fish stew that originated in the area, and enjoyed
local wines and spirits.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Marseille with a day trip to Paris was a
fantastic adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and natural
beauty. The locals are friendly and welcoming, and the food is
delicious. The day trip to Paris was a great way to see some of the most
famous landmarks in the world, and I’m glad I took the time to explore
this beautiful city. It’s a trip that I will never forget and one that I
would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable
travel experience.</p>
<p>I also hungout with some people at the local hostel bar! Which I
should remember to do that sooner in my travels so I can make friends
earlier. But whatever, still a fun time!</p>

<h3>Week of July 11th</h3>
<p>Barcelona is a vibrant city located on the northeastern coast of
Spain. It’s known for its stunning architecture, delicious food, and
lively culture. I had the opportunity to spend a week exploring this
incredible city, and it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the iconic Sagrada
Familia, a massive basilica that has been under construction since 1882.
The intricate details and stunning design of the basilica were truly
breathtaking, and it was amazing to see the progress that has been made
on this incredible structure.</p>
<p>I walked along La Rambla, a bustling street lined with shops,
restaurants, and street performers, and explored the Gothic Quarter, a
historic area filled with narrow streets, beautiful buildings, and
fascinating history.</p>
<p>The food in Barcelona was another highlight of my trip. I indulged in
traditional dishes like paella and patatas bravas. I also enjoyed
delicious tapas and local wines, and explored the city’s vibrant food
scene. Of course I had sangria… I mean come on.</p>
<p>Aside from the city’s attractions, I also spent time relaxing on the
beach and taking in the beautiful Mediterranean Sea. Barcelona has some
of the best beaches in Europe, and it was a great way to unwind and soak
up the sun.</p>
<p>And of course there was so much volleyball every single day! That
place was awesome!!! I’ve never been welcomed by so many people before!
Seriously the nicest people to ever play the sport and just welcome in
strangers like no problem. That would never happen in the US to
strangers. But hey, Europeans are nicer I suppose.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Barcelona was an incredible experience. The city
is full of history, culture, and natural beauty. The architecture is
stunning, the food is delicious, and the people are friendly and
welcoming. It’s a trip that I will never forget and one that I would
highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>And hey that was the end of my 2022 Euro Trip. Come back shortly for
my 2023 Euro Trip…</p>

<div id="my-first-autumn-october-30th---november-13th"
class="section level3">
<h3>My First Autumn (October 30th - November 13th)</h3>
<p>Autumn is a beautiful season in the northeastern United States, with
the changing leaves creating a stunning display of colors. I had the
opportunity to spend two weeks in November exploring the area around New
Brunswick, New York City, and Philadelphia, and it was an incredible
trip.</p>
<p>I started my trip with New York City, which was bustling with energy
and excitement. And it was warm! It was like 72 degrees as the high when
I was there. I thought I needed to bring more sweats and sweatshirts on
my trip, but surprisingly, I didn’t need them! The city was also filled
with beautiful autumn leaves, especially in Central Park. I spent a day
exploring the park, taking in the colorful foliage and enjoying the
crisp fall air. I spent a lot of time playing volleyball and walking as
much as I could! When I was able to wander and spend more time around
the city, I skipped the subway and chose to walk the 10 miles. It was
beautiful as a California native! I got to see Alex Morris for the 4th
time this year! Truly the nicest person I have ever met and it was
lovely seeing her! I hope she and Max get engaged!</p>
<p>Also, I got to stay in the Lower East Side with a friend and she had
an incredible high rise apartment with an awesome view! Such a cool
experience being there!</p>
<p>Next, I headed to New Brunswick, NJ, where I stayed with friends
(Mina and Ted - who are moving to California in March 2023!) who showed
me around the area. They live next to this beautiful tree filled with
reds, oranges, and yellows in their leaves and my eyes were truly seeing
some true beauty for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, I took a short train ride to Philadelphia, which was also
full of autumn beauty. I explored the historic Old City neighborhood,
where I saw the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, and visited the
beautiful Fairmount Park, which was full of colorful trees and peaceful
trails. I got to see my cousin, Blake, and met his son, Wesley, for the
first time! Such a fun time over there!</p>
<p>Throughout my trip, I always try some tasty foods and I will always
go to Joe’s Pizza whenever I’m in NYC. I also went to a club in NYC
where they played ‘Empire State of Mind’ which everyone lost their shit
over. Also had Philly cheesesteak for the first time. In Philadelphia!
Crazy stuff, I know.</p>
<p>Overall, my two-week trip to New Brunswick, NJ, NYC, and Philly to
see autumn leaves was a beautiful and memorable experience. I highly
recommend this trip to anyone who wants to explore the natural beauty
and vibrant culture of the northeastern United States in the fall.</p>

<h3>Week of May 22nd</h3>
<p>EUROPE ROUND 2 YO!</p>
<p>So I went to Porto! I had the pleasure of immersing myself in the
charm of Porto for a week, and every moment felt like a step back in
time. One of the city’s standout attractions is the awe-inspiring Dom
Luís I Bridge, an iconic double-deck iron bridge that spans the river
and offers panoramic views of the city. As I strolled across its upper
level, I couldn’t help but be mesmerized by the intricate architecture
and the breathtaking vistas that unfolded before me. I mean it was the
same guy who did the Eiffel Tower so should I be surprised?</p>
<p>A visit to Porto wouldn’t be complete without exploring the historic
Ribeira district. This UNESCO World Heritage site is a maze of narrow
alleyways, colorful facades, and charming cafes. I found myself
wandering through the winding streets, soaking in the atmosphere and
discovering hidden gems at every turn. The medieval buildings and tiled
façades exude a sense of old-world charm that is truly captivating.</p>
<p>No trip to Porto would be complete without indulging in its most
famous export: port wine. The city is renowned for its port wine
cellars, where you can take guided tours and learn about the fascinating
history and production process of this sweet elixir. I had the pleasure
of savoring a variety of port wines, from the rich and velvety vintage
ports to the fruity and aromatic tawnies. Each sip was a celebration of
the city’s rich winemaking heritage.</p>
<p>In addition to its architectural and culinary delights, Porto offers
a vibrant cultural scene. I explored the Livraria Lello, a breathtaking
bookstore that is said to have inspired J.K. Rowling in the creation of
Hogwarts. Its magnificent wooden staircase and ornate art nouveau design
make it a true bibliophile’s paradise. I also visited the contemporary
art museum, the Serralves Foundation, where I was captivated by the
thought-provoking exhibitions and the stunning surrounding gardens.</p>
<p>Porto is not just a city of cultural and historical significance; it
is also a city of warmth and hospitality. The locals, known as
“tripeiros,” greeted me with open arms and made me feel right at home.
Whether it was engaging in lively conversations at a local café or
receiving recommendations for the best traditional dishes, the warmth
and friendliness of the people added an extra layer of magic to my Porto
experience.</p>
<p>Of course, no visit to Porto would be complete without savoring the
delectable local cuisine. I savored the iconic Francesinha, a hearty
sandwich layered with ham, sausage, steak, and melted cheese, topped
with a rich tomato sauce. Damn it was heavy! And let’s not forget the
pastel de nata, the creamy custard tart that is a true Portuguese
delight. Each meal was a celebration of the city’s culinary heritage,
and I found myself falling in love with the flavors and aromas of
Porto.</p>
<p>As I bid farewell to this charming city, I couldn’t help but feel a
sense of nostalgia already. Porto had welcomed me with open arms, and I
was leaving with a heart full of memories and a newfound appreciation
for its rich history, cultural treasures, and warm-hearted people. Porto
is a city that leaves an indelible mark on your soul, and I can
wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an unforgettable travel
experience.</p>

<h3>Week of May 29th</h3>
<p>Wedding week in Barcelona! Not too much more to say about Barcelona
though. I have already been there, but now I am a part of a morning
volleyball group on WhatsApp. So I can always expect to get games in the
morning whenever I am in town, so that’s awesome.</p>
<p>Also, I could not get a lick of sleep in that hostel. I have never
heard of anyone snore so damn loud. I mean I snore pretty loud
sometimes, and I wish whoever I am sleeping with the best, but god
damn…</p>

<h3>Week of June 4th</h3>
<p>In my recent week-long adventure on the captivating island of Crete,
I immersed myself in its rich culture, indulged in delightful culinary
experiences, and explored the island’s natural wonders. This
unforgettable journey took me from savoring mouthwatering gyros to
lounging on the sandy shores of Matala Beach and conquering the
challenging trails of the Samaria Gorge.</p>
<p>One highlight of my trip was the daily ritual of relishing a gyro.
These delicious wraps filled with succulent meat, fresh vegetables, and
flavorful tzatziki sauce quickly became my go-to meal. Whether it was
for lunch or a quick snack, I couldn’t resist the temptation of these
Greek delights.</p>
<p>Matala Beach offered a tranquil escape, where I basked in the warm
Mediterranean sun and listened to the soothing sound of the waves. The
breathtaking beauty of the clear turquoise waters and the distinctive
cliffside caves added a touch of magic to my beach experience.</p>
<p>However, the ultimate test of endurance awaited me at the famous
Samaria Gorge. Embarking on a six-hour hike, starting from the village
and making my way back, was a physically demanding yet rewarding
endeavor. As I ventured through the majestic cliffs and lush vegetation,
the sheer scale and untouched beauty of the gorge left me awestruck.
Though exhausting, the experience was a testament to the natural wonders
that Crete has to offer.</p>
<p>Crete’s charm extends beyond its culinary delights and picturesque
beaches. The island’s rich history, warm hospitality, and diverse
landscapes create a captivating tapestry that leaves an indelible mark
on visitors.</p>
<p>As I reminisce about my time in Crete, I am filled with gratitude for
the incredible experiences I had, from savoring gyros to exploring
Matala Beach and conquering the Samaria Gorge. This Mediterranean gem
truly offers a vibrant and memorable travel experience for those seeking
a blend of adventure, relaxation, and cultural immersion.</p>
<p>Also, Makenna and Caitlin were there and that was awesome! It has
been weird not being alone at all on this trip so far… But hey, I can
get behind it for the most part. I do enjoy my alone time and that
includes a lot of time to self reflect. But sometimes it’s lonely being
alone for too long. I’ll find that balance someday in life.</p>
<p>Also, also, I went to Athens for 7 hours and had a blast! I saw the
freaking Acropolis! Athens is awesome, and I would love to explore more
of Greece to see where each god gets their legends from. So thank you
Athena for your beautiful city.</p>
</div>
<div id="week-of-june-11th" class="section level3">
<h3>Week of June 11th</h3>
<p>The week started with a rush of adrenaline as I found myself
sprinting through the Athens airport. Can you believe I almost missed my
flight? Yes, it sounds like a scene from an action movie, but it
happened! As I navigated my way through the bustling terminals, I
couldn’t help but wonder how my journey would unfold.</p>
<p>My first fun stop was in Belgrade, where I spent a night exploring
the city’s hidden treasures. What caught my eye the most was the
impressive wall art scattered across the streets. Each mural told a
different story, and I found myself lost in the creativity and
expression of the artists. It’s incredible how art can transcend
boundaries and connect people from different cultures.</p>
<p>But the real adventure began when I arrived in Kotor, a dreamy town
nestled in the heart of a picturesque fjord. The moment I set foot in
Kotor, it felt like stepping into a fairytale. The town’s charm was
undeniable, and the warm welcome from the resident feline friends—yes,
adorable cats.</p>
<p>I embarked on a hike that took me up the hills, and the effort was
more than rewarded by breathtaking views that left me in awe of nature’s
majesty. Plus, I hiked up an interesting trail that had me hug the wall
and look down towards a potential early grave. But still a fun time! The
rugged mountains juxtaposed with the calm waters below created a sight
I’ll carry in my heart forever. And let me tell you, if you ever visit
Kotor, don’t forget to rent a bike! Pedaling through the quaint streets
and exploring every nook and cranny was a delightful experience.</p>
<p>As if all of this wasn’t magical enough, fate had yet another
surprise in store for me. Can you imagine waking up to the sound of an
orchestra rehearsing the enchanting score of “Pirates of the Caribbean”
just outside your Airbnb? It felt like being part of a cinematic
adventure, and I couldn’t help but smile at the serendipity of the
moment.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this week, I’m reminded of the beauty of embracing
spontaneity and the joy of being open to new experiences. Life has its
twists and turns, and sometimes the best memories are created when we
veer off the beaten path. The mishaps and surprises along the way only
added to the richness of my journey.</p>
<p>Remember that life’s adventures await in unexpected places. Embrace
the detours, appreciate the art around you, immerse yourself in nature’s
wonders, and be open to the symphony of life playing just outside your
door.</p>

<h3>Week of June 18th</h3>
<p>Wedding week!</p>
<p>The past week has been an unforgettable adventure filled with love,
celebrations, and mouthwatering treats. It all began in the romantic
city of Paris, where I had the pleasure of spending time with my best
friend, Sumedh. Together, we explored the enchanting streets, admired
iconic landmarks, and indulged in the heavenly taste of freshly baked
croissants.</p>
<p>But the true highlight of the week was the joyous occasion in
Normandy, where I attended Sumedh’s brother’s (Supreet) wedding. The
two-day Indian wedding was a mesmerizing blend of traditions, colors,
and festivities. Witnessing the couple’s love story unfold through
traditional rituals, vibrant dances, and heartwarming speeches left me
with an overwhelming feeling of happiness and gratitude.</p>
<p>The fusion of Indian, Jewish, and French cultures at the wedding was
a beautiful testament to the power of love and the coming together of
two families. The celebration served as a reminder that love knows no
boundaries and that it can be celebrated in many ways, transcending
cultural differences.</p>
<p>As the wedding celebrations came to an end, I bid farewell to
Normandy and returned to Paris. There, I embraced the vibrant energy of
the city and had a blast playing volleyball. And let’s not forget the
delicious croissants that I couldn’t resist enjoying throughout my stay
in the city of gastronomy.</p>
<p>This week has been a rollercoaster of emotions, from the excitement
of exploring Paris to the warmth and joy of celebrating love in
Normandy. It has reminded me of the importance of cherishing every
moment, treasuring the company of loved ones, and savoring the
experiences that life gifts us.</p>
<p>As I reflect on the memories of this unforgettable week, I’m filled
with gratitude for the moments that made me smile, the love that
surrounded me, and the delicious croissants that added a touch of
sweetness to each day.</p>
<p>Dancing is always fun too.</p>

<h3>Week of June 25th</h3>
<p>As I continue to traverse the picturesque landscapes of Northern
Europe, I’m thrilled to share the memories of a unique adventure that
took me from the serene charm of Aalborg, Denmark, to the dynamic energy
of Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<p>My journey commenced in the enchanting city of Aalborg, where I was
immediately captivated by its cozy atmosphere and welcoming locals.
Strolling through cobbled streets, I soaked in the city’s rich history,
passing by landmarks such as the Aalborghus Castle and the imposing
Budolfi Church. Aalborg’s picturesque waterfront, adorned with charming
cafes, made for the perfect spot to relax and savor traditional Danish
pastries.</p>
<p>As the sun painted the sky with hues of gold and pink, I found myself
on the Limfjord Bridge, watching in awe as the day transitioned into a
mesmerizing sunset. The beauty of nature’s wonders unfolded before my
eyes, leaving an indelible mark on my soul. It was so cool seeing such a
late sunset! It was the furthest north I’ve ever been.</p>
<p>Three days in Aalborg passed by in a flash, but my thirst for
exploration was far from quenched. I bid farewell to the charming Danish
city and set my sights on the vibrant metropolis of Hamburg,
Germany.</p>
<p>As I arrived in Hamburg, the city’s dynamic energy immediately drew
me in. The juxtaposition of modern architecture with historical
landmarks was a sight to behold. The Rathaus, Hamburg’s iconic City
Hall, stood tall and proud, reflecting the city’s rich history.</p>
<p>In Hamburg, I couldn’t resist indulging in the city’s most famous
culinary creation - the hamburger. The delicious flavors of a classic
hamburger tantalized my taste buds, leaving me wanting more.</p>
<p>The heartbeat of Hamburg’s culture lies in its people, and I found
myself forming beautiful connections with fellow travelers and locals
alike. One shared passion united us - volleyball. Days were filled with
friendly matches, and the camaraderie we built over the sandy courts
added a special touch to my Hamburg experience.</p>
<p>Beyond the city’s vibrant center, I explored the serene beauty along
the Elbe River, where tranquility enveloped me like a warm embrace.
These moments of peace were the perfect balance to the city’s lively
atmosphere.</p>
<p>My time in Hamburg was a beautiful amalgamation of exploration,
gastronomic delights, and unforgettable connections. I couldn’t have
asked for a more fulfilling journey.</p>
<p>Hamburg people were so nice. So glad I beat their butts in volleyball
just like we did in WW2.</p>

<h3>Week of July 2nd</h3>
<p>Prepare to be whisked away on a journey of epic bike rides,
delectable pasta, and awe-inspiring Swiss landscapes. Join me as I
recount the memories of an unforgettable summer filled with exploration
and beauty.</p>
<p>My adventure commenced in Zurich, Switzerland, where I embarked on a
daring 100-mile bike ride through the rolling hills of this picturesque
country. The journey to Thun was nothing short of a cycling paradise, as
I pedaled my way through lush green fields, charming villages, and
scenic countryside. With every turn of the pedal, Switzerland’s natural
splendor unfolded before my eyes, leaving me in awe of its breathtaking
beauty. I also got crazy sore and so tired on this bike ride. It was
cool biking through these hills and essentially hearing windchimes
because of all the cows and goats with bells on their necks</p>
<p>Oh also I almost got arrested by the Swiss for biking on the
autobahn. Oops.</p>
<p>The challenge of the long ride was rewarded by the stunning views of
Lake Thun as I finally arrived at my destination. The shimmering blue
waters against the backdrop of majestic mountains were a sight to
behold, a reward for my perseverance and determination. Also, omg
Interlaken was crazy beautiful too. That small city is nestled between
two beautiful lakes and a river you can put your water bottle in and get
fresh water.</p>
<p>After the exhilarating bike ride, I hopped on a train to Bologna,
Italy, to indulge in the ultimate comfort food - pasta! Bologna is
renowned for its culinary delights, and I eagerly embraced the
opportunity to savor traditional Italian dishes. From rich and creamy
carbonara to comforting plates of lasagna, every bite was a celebration
of flavors that delighted my taste buds. Of course I had their
Bolognese.</p>
<p>With my energy replenished, I ventured back to Switzerland to
experience another delightful event - a volleyball tournament in Gstaad.
The picturesque alpine setting of Gstaad served as the backdrop for
thrilling volleyball matches, adding an exciting twist to my summer
adventure.</p>
<p>But the journey didn’t end there. In the enchanting region of
Lauterbrunnen, I hopped on my bike again and embarked on a scenic ride
to Grindelwald. The beauty of this summer day was magnified by the
lingering snow on the mountain peaks, creating a stunning contrast
between the warmth of the season and the remnants of winter’s embrace.
The sight was truly mesmerizing, and I couldn’t help but be in awe of
nature’s ever-changing canvas.</p>
<p>As I pedaled along, I felt a profound sense of appreciation for the
beauty that surrounded me. The Swiss landscapes seemed to have leaped
straight out of a postcard, and every moment was a reminder of the
wonders that await us when we venture into the great outdoors.</p>
<p>This summer has been a true celebration of adventure, culture, and
the simple pleasures of life. From the breathtaking Swiss landscapes to
the tantalizing tastes of Italy, every experience has left an indelible
mark on my heart.</p>
<p>Switzerland is expensive though. Can’t wait to go back when I’m
rich.</p>

<h3>Week of July 9th</h3>
<p>Prepare to join me on a thrilling journey through the vibrant cities
of Ireland, where I immersed myself in the lively Irish culture, made
new friends, and celebrated my namesake in a place close to my
heart.</p>
<p>The week began in the bustling city of Dublin, where I was instantly
enchanted by its lively atmosphere and warm hospitality. Dublin’s
legendary pubs provided the perfect setting for an unforgettable night
of drinks, laughter, and live music. I found myself tapping my feet and
singing along to my favorite covers of music, surrounded by like-minded
souls. The camaraderie was palpable, and I couldn’t have asked for a
better night to kickstart my Irish adventure.</p>
<p>The next day, I set off on a short but meaningful detour to Cavan, a
town with special significance to me. As my namesake, I couldn’t resist
the opportunity to embrace my connection to this place. I proudly donned
a Cavan hat and shirt, wearing my love for this charming town on my
sleeve.</p>
<p>With cherished memories of Cavan in my heart, I continued my journey
to Galway for the rest of the week. Galway’s bohemian vibe and lively
streets beckoned, promising an adventure of its own.</p>
<p>As I wandered through Galway’s vibrant markets and colorful streets,
I was captivated by its artistic flair. The city’s love for art and
culture was evident in every corner, from street performances to
captivating galleries.</p>
<p>But my true heart was won by the enchanting sounds of traditional
Irish music that filled the air. I couldn’t resist the urge to join in
the festivities, dancing and clapping along to the infectious beats.</p>
<p>Galway also introduced me to new friends with whom I shared laughter,
stories, and the joy of discovering Ireland’s hidden gems. We explored
quaint villages, hiked through lush green valleys, and relished every
moment of our time together.</p>
<p>As the week drew to a close, I reflected on the whirlwind of
experiences that had filled my heart with joy. Ireland had gifted me
with the best of music, new connections, and cherished memories. Each
city had a unique charm, but it was the warmth of the Irish people that
truly made this adventure unforgettable.</p>

<h3>Week of July 16th</h3>
<p>Another week of everyone speaking English! It’s pretty refreshing
honestly.</p>
<p>My journey in London began with the excitement of exploring this
iconic city on foot. I strolled through its charming streets, soaking in
the grandeur of its historical landmarks and the pulsating energy of the
bustling metropolis. With every step, I marveled at the fusion of the
old and the new that gave London its unique charm.</p>
<p>London’s renowned theater scene beckoned me, but alas, I didn’t get a
chance to see a show. However, the vibrant atmosphere of the West End
and the captivating marquees only heightened my desire to experience the
magic of London’s live performances on my next visit.</p>
<p>Being a food enthusiast, I was eager to savor the diverse culinary
delights that London had to offer. My taste buds were treated to a
delightful journey through various cuisines. Indian food, with its
aromatic spices and rich flavors, stole my heart. I relished every bite
of delectable curries, naans, and samosas, immersing myself in the
diverse and mouthwatering tastes.</p>
<p>A stroll through London’s Chinatown introduced me to the tantalizing
world of Chinese cuisine. From mouthwatering dim sum to sizzling
stir-fries, every dish was a celebration of flavors and textures. The
vibrant and bustling atmosphere of Chinatown made the experience all the
more memorable.</p>
<p>And, of course, no visit to London would be complete without
indulging in the classic British dish - fish and chips. I savored the
crispy batter and tender fish, enjoying this quintessential meal as I
sat by the River Thames, watching the world go by.</p>
<p>London’s iconic sights were an integral part of my adventure. I stood
in awe of the majestic Buckingham Palace, marveled at the architectural
splendor of Westminster Abbey, and crossed the historic Tower Bridge
with a sense of wonder.</p>
<p>Of course visited the British Museum of stolen art and graverobbing.
But hey the Brits preserve their stuff well at least.</p>

<h3>Week of July 23rd</h3>
<p>Allow me to take you on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting
city of Prague, where I was captivated by its breathtaking spires and
endless beauty.</p>
<p>From the moment I arrived in Prague, I knew I was in for a treat. The
city’s skyline was adorned with a plethora of majestic spires, each one
reaching towards the heavens, as if trying to touch the clouds. I
couldn’t help but be in awe of their grandeur and elegance, which seemed
to tell stories of centuries gone by.</p>
<p>Walking through the historic streets, I found myself surrounded by a
rich tapestry of medieval buildings, each one more beautiful than the
last. The architecture was a harmonious blend of Gothic, Baroque, and
Romanesque styles, creating a dreamlike landscape that felt straight out
of a fairy tale.</p>
<p>The iconic Prague Castle, standing tall and proud atop a hill, was an
awe-inspiring sight. Its intricate details and imposing presence left me
with a sense of reverence for the history and culture that it
symbolized.</p>
<p>The Charles Bridge, a masterpiece of medieval engineering, provided a
stunning vantage point to take in the city’s charm. As I walked along
the bridge, I marveled at the statues lining its edges, each one adding
to the bridge’s allure.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the landmarks that made Prague unforgettable; it
was the spirit of the city and its warm and welcoming people. Exploring
the charming neighborhoods, I felt a sense of belonging as I immersed
myself in the local culture and traditions.</p>
<p>The city’s vibrant arts scene was a delight to experience. I spent
hours wandering through art galleries, soaking in the creativity of
local artists, and enjoying live performances that filled the streets
with music and joy.</p>

<h3>Week of July 30th</h3>
<p>I felt like I needed some tasty food. So here is me making up for
this.</p>
<p>My week of indulgence began with a delightful stopover in Vienna, a
city known for its rich history and elegant charm. However, this time,
my focus was on reuniting with friends I had met during a previous
adventure. The joy of rekindling old connections was simply
heartwarming, and we spent the night catching up over delicious Viennese
delicacies. From savory schnitzels to heavenly Sachertorte, every bite
was a celebration of friendship and culinary delights.</p>
<p>With my spirits high and my appetite thoroughly whetted, I continued
my culinary expedition to Budapest, a city renowned for its vibrant food
scene. As I wandered through the bustling streets, the aroma of
mouthwatering Hungarian dishes filled the air. I couldn’t resist the
temptation to savor the flavors of traditional goulash, hearty langos,
and sweet chimney cakes. Each meal was an enchanting journey through the
rich tapestry of Hungarian cuisine.</p>
<p>Apart from the delectable food, Budapest’s charm was undeniable. The
stunning architecture, thermal baths, and scenic Danube River provided a
perfect backdrop for my gastronomic adventures.</p>
<p>Next on my list was the city of Napoli, Italy, famous for its
authentic pizza and scrumptious pasta dishes. As I arrived in Napoli, I
was immediately embraced by the warm and lively atmosphere of the city.
The streets were alive with the sounds of laughter, the aroma of freshly
baked pizzas, and the joyous spirit of Italian culture.</p>
<p>In Napoli, I feasted on a myriad of pizza varieties, each one a
culinary masterpiece in its own right. The simplicity of the ingredients
combined with the skill of the pizzaiolos created a burst of flavors
that danced on my palate.</p>
<p>But Napoli’s culinary delights didn’t end with pizza; I also relished
the opportunity to indulge in the city’s renowned pasta dishes. From
comforting bowls of spaghetti alle vongole to velvety plates of gnocchi,
each dish was a revelation of Italian culinary artistry.</p>
<p>As the week came to a close, I couldn’t help but reflect on the
incredible journey I had undertaken in pursuit of good food and great
company. This week reminded me Italy has conquered the food world of
Europe. Can anyone step up to claim that title?</p>
