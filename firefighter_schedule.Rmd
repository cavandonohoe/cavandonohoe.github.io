Jason, Owen, and Wyett's Work Schedule for the next `r years_till_retirement` years (Retire at 65 right?). Should be a fun journey for them! Keep battling those fires! 

This is based on the Kelly Schedule.

## Owen's:

```{r}
segments_and_weekends_a %>%
  filter(days >= as.Date(Sys.Date())) %>% 
  select(date = days, day_of_week, work_status, type) %>% 
  datatable(filter = "top", extensions = "Buttons",
            options = list(paging = TRUE, dom = "Bfrtip", buttons = c("copy", "csv", "excel"),
                           pageLength = 500,
                           scrollY = "400px", scrollX = TRUE))
```

## Jason's:

```{r}
segments_and_weekends_b %>%
  filter(days >= as.Date(Sys.Date())) %>% 
  select(date = days, day_of_week, work_status, type) %>% 
  datatable(filter = "top", extensions = "Buttons",

                           pageLength = 500,
                           scrollY = "400px", scrollX = TRUE))
```

## Wyett's:

```{r}
segments_and_weekends_c %>%
  filter(days >= as.Date(Sys.Date())) %>% 
  select(date = days, day_of_week, work_status, type) %>%
