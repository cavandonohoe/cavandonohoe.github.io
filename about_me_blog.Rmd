### Week of May 16th, 2022

Travelling to a new place for the first time can be both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. Especially when it's outside of your comfort zone. I recently had the opportunity to travel to Madrid, Spain for a week, which marked my first international trip outside of North America. And let me tell you, it was an experience I will never forget.

Madrid is a vibrant city filled with history, art, culture, and amazing food. The city is a mix of old and new, with beautiful architecture that has stood the test of time. One of the first things that struck me about Madrid was the warmth of the people. From the airport to the streets, everyone was friendly and welcoming, making me feel right at home.

As I explored the city, I found myself constantly in awe of the stunning buildings, monuments, and parks. The Royal Palace of Madrid, with its intricate details and grandeur, was one of my favorite sights. Walking through the Puerta del Sol, one of the busiest squares in Madrid, I felt like I was part of the hustle and bustle of city life.

But what I enjoyed most about Madrid was its food culture. From tapas to paella, Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its bold flavors and deliciousness. I visited many local restaurants and cafes, trying everything from traditional Spanish dishes to fusion cuisine. My personal favorite was a small tapas bar in the Malasa√±a neighborhood that served the most amazing patatas bravas I have ever tasted.

One of the biggest challenges I faced during my trip was the language barrier. Although many people in Madrid speak English, it was still difficult at times to communicate effectively. However, I quickly learned that a smile and a willingness to try to speak Spanish went a long way in breaking down barriers and building connections with the locals.

In conclusion, my first international trip to Madrid was a life-changing experience. It opened my eyes to a new culture, language, and way of life. It taught me to be more adventurous and open-minded, and to embrace new experiences with enthusiasm. I can't wait to plan my next international adventure and see what other exciting opportunities await.

Also, I just thought of a little bit more to add to this...

Certainly, working remotely while traveling can be a unique experience, and Madrid was no exception. Despite the time difference, I was able to maintain my work schedule in the Pacific Time Zone while enjoying everything the city had to offer.

One of the perks of working remotely while traveling is the flexibility it provides. I could explore the city during the day, try different foods, and visit museums and landmarks, all while still being able to attend virtual meetings and complete my work tasks.

Working remotely also allowed me to immerse myself more fully in the local culture. I visited local cafes and co-working spaces, where I had the opportunity to meet locals and other travelers who were also working remotely. It was interesting to learn about their experiences and how they balanced work and travel.

Overall, working remotely in Madrid was a great experience. It gave me the freedom to travel and explore a new city while also staying on top of my work responsibilities. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity to do so.

To get real for a sec: This was a good start to the trip. I started walking a bunch and really enjoyed seeing everyone else there. It was pretty warm there and there wasn't great water in the Airbnb butttt it was really awesome going to the nearby square to get more water. And people were there till I was done working at 2am. I should have struck up a conversation with some random people over there. Oh well, missed opportunity.

### Week of May 23rd, 2022

Biking the Amalfi Coast is one of the most iconic experiences in Italy. The stunning coastal views, charming towns, and delicious food make it a must-see destination for any traveler. But what happens when you rent an electric bike and are too proud to use the electric part? That's exactly what happened to me during my trip to Naples, Italy.

After spending a week in Madrid, I was ready for my next adventure. I decided to visit Naples and rent an electric bike to explore the Amalfi Coast. However, when I picked up the bike, I forgot to turn on the electric assist. As a result, I was left with a heavy bike that was difficult to pedal, especially on the steep hills of the Amalfi Coast.

Despite the challenging start, I decided to embrace the experience and set off on my adventure. I took a train to Salerno, a town at the southern end of the Amalfi Coast, and started my bike ride along the winding roads that hug the coastline.

The views were breathtaking. The turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea sparkled in the sunlight, and the colorful houses perched on the hillsides added to the charm of the towns. However, as the day went on, I began to feel the strain of pedaling a heavy bike uphill.

At times, I had to slow down and catch my breath but never ever push my bike. It was actually impossible to walk with a bike on the windy streets of the Amalfi Coast just because the streets were so narrow. It was exhausting though. But with each turn, the stunning views made it all worth it. I passed through charming towns like Vietri sul Mare, Amalfi, and Positano, each with its unique character and beauty.

As the sun began to set, I reached the end of my bike ride and arrived back in Sorrento. However, the adventure wasn't quite over. When I tried to take the bike on the train back to Naples, I was told that I couldn't because of the size of the bike. I had to pedal the entire way back to Naples, which was challenging, but also a fitting end to the day's adventure.

In conclusion, biking the Amalfi Coast on a heavy bike was a unique experience. While it was challenging at times, it was also incredibly rewarding. The stunning views, charming towns, and sense of accomplishment made it a trip I will never forget. It reminded me that sometimes, the most memorable experiences come from stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing the journey, even if it doesn't go as planned.

This trip also featured Janella and Becky who made the trip so much better. I realized how nice it was to have a balance of seeing friends and also doing my own thing. It does get lonely if it's just me doing my own thing days on end. But then again, you'd think I'd get lonely on that massive 75 mile bike ride along the Amalfi Coast. But for some reason, that felt great. This form of long term traveling seems to get me to learn more and more about myself.
