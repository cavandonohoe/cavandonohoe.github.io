<h3>Week of May 16th, 2022</h3>
<p>Travelling to a new place for the first time can be both exhilarating
and nerve-wracking. Especially when itâ€™s outside of your comfort zone. I
recently had the opportunity to travel to Madrid, Spain for a week,
which marked my first international trip outside of North America. And
let me tell you, it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>Madrid is a vibrant city filled with history, art, culture, and
amazing food. The city is a mix of old and new, with beautiful
architecture that has stood the test of time. One of the first things
that struck me about Madrid was the warmth of the people. From the
airport to the streets, everyone was friendly and welcoming, making me
feel right at home.</p>
<p>As I explored the city, I found myself constantly in awe of the
stunning buildings, monuments, and parks. The Royal Palace of Madrid,
with its intricate details and grandeur, was one of my favorite sights.
Walking through the Puerta del Sol, one of the busiest squares in
Madrid, I felt like I was part of the hustle and bustle of city
life.</p>
<p>But what I enjoyed most about Madrid was its food culture. From tapas
to paella, Spanish cuisine is world-renowned for its bold flavors and
deliciousness. I visited many local restaurants and cafes, trying
everything from traditional Spanish dishes to fusion cuisine. My
personal favorite was a small tapas bar in the MalasaÃ±a neighborhood
that served the most amazing patatas bravas I have ever tasted. And some
dank sangria!</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during my trip was the language
barrier. Although many people in Madrid speak English, it was still
difficult at times to communicate effectively. However, I quickly
learned that a smile and a willingness to try to speak Spanish went a
long way in breaking down barriers and building connections with the
locals. Plus, Google Translate was super effective with ordering food
and what not. Also, in a lot of places in Europe, they wonâ€™t come around
with the bill, so youâ€™ll actually have to get the courage to ask
them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my first international trip to Madrid was a
life-changing experience. It opened my eyes to a new culture, language,
and way of life. It taught me to be more adventurous and open-minded,
and to embrace new experiences with enthusiasm. I canâ€™t wait to plan my
next international adventure and see what other exciting opportunities
await.</p>
<p>Also, I just thought of a little bit more to add to thisâ€¦</p>
<p>Certainly, working remotely while traveling can be a unique
experience, and Madrid was no exception. Despite the time difference, I
was able to maintain my work schedule in the Pacific Time Zone while
enjoying everything the city had to offer.</p>
<p>One of the perks of working remotely while traveling is the
flexibility it provides. I could explore the city during the day, try
different foods, and visit museums and landmarks, all while still being
able to attend virtual meetings and complete my work tasks.</p>
<p>Working remotely also allowed me to immerse myself more fully in the
local culture. I visited local cafes and co-working spaces, where I had
the opportunity to meet locals and other travelers who were also working
remotely. It was interesting to learn about their experiences and how
they balanced work and travel.</p>
<p>Overall, working remotely in Madrid was a great experience. It gave
me the freedom to travel and explore a new city while also staying on
top of my work responsibilities. I would highly recommend it to anyone
who has the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>To get real for a sec: This was a good start to the trip. I started
walking a bunch and really enjoyed seeing everyone else there. It was
pretty warm there and there wasnâ€™t great water in the Airbnb butttt it
was really awesome going to the nearby square to get more water. And
people were there till I was done working at 2am. I should have struck
up a conversation with some random people over there. Oh well, missed
opportunity.</p>

<h3>Week of May 23rd, 2022</h3>
<p>Biking the Amalfi Coast is one of the most iconic experiences in
Italy. The stunning coastal views, charming towns, and delicious food
make it a must-see destination for any traveler. But what happens when
you rent an electric bike and are too proud to use the electric part?
Thatâ€™s exactly what happened to me during my trip to Naples, Italy.</p>
<p>After spending a week in Madrid, I was ready for my next adventure. I
decided to visit Naples and rent an electric bike to explore the Amalfi
Coast. However, when I picked up the bike, I forgot to turn on the
electric assist. As a result, I was left with a heavy bike that was
difficult to pedal, especially on the steep hills of the Amalfi
Coast.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging start, I decided to embrace the experience
and set off on my adventure. I took a train to Salerno, a town at the
southern end of the Amalfi Coast, and started my bike ride along the
winding roads that hug the coastline.</p>
<p>The views were breathtaking. The turquoise waters of the Tyrrhenian
Sea sparkled in the sunlight, and the colorful houses perched on the
hillsides added to the charm of the towns. However, as the day went on,
I began to feel the strain of pedaling a heavy bike uphill.</p>
<p>At times, I had to slow down and catch my breath but never ever push
my bike. It was actually impossible to walk with a bike on the windy
streets of the Amalfi Coast just because the streets were so narrow. It
was exhausting though. But with each turn, the stunning views made it
all worth it. I passed through charming towns like Vietri sul Mare,
Amalfi, and Positano, each with its unique character and beauty.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, I reached the end of my bike ride and
arrived back in Sorrento. However, the adventure wasnâ€™t quite over. When
I tried to take the bike on the train back to Naples, I was told that I
couldnâ€™t because of the size of the bike. I had to pedal the entire way
back to Naples, which was challenging, but also a fitting end to the
dayâ€™s adventure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, biking the Amalfi Coast on a heavy bike was a unique
experience. While it was challenging at times, it was also incredibly
rewarding. The stunning views, charming towns, and sense of
accomplishment made it a trip I will never forget. It reminded me that
sometimes, the most memorable experiences come from stepping out of your
comfort zone and embracing the journey, even if it doesnâ€™t go as
planned.</p>
<p>This trip also featured Janella and Becky who made the trip so much
better. I realized how nice it was to have a balance of seeing friends
and also doing my own thing. It does get lonely if itâ€™s just me doing my
own thing days on end. But then again, youâ€™d think Iâ€™d get lonely on
that massive 75 mile bike ride along the Amalfi Coast. But for some
reason, that felt great. This form of long term traveling seems to get
me to learn more and more about myself.</p>

<h3>May 30th - June 19th 2022</h3>
<p>Rome is one of the most vibrant and historic cities in the world, and
I had the opportunity to explore it for three weeks. During my trip, I
stayed at my friend Mauroâ€™s place, watched the 2022 FIVB World Tour
Finals tournament, and had an amazing time. I also got to hangout with
Shannon Costa and got to meet some of my favorite volleyball players in
the world! Mauro was only there for one week too! Itâ€™s very funny
because he was only there for one week, while I was there for 3â€¦</p>
<p>One of the best things about staying with a local is that you get a
unique perspective on the city. Mauro was a great host, showing me the
hidden gems of Rome that are often overlooked by tourists. We had some
truly authentic Italian food and he showed me things my tongue only
dreamed about. Like in a non sexual way. It was a great way to immerse
myself in the local culture and get a true taste of Rome.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was attending the 2022 FIVB World
Tour Finals tournament. The tournament featured some of the best
volleyball players in the world, and the matches were intense and
exciting. I got to see top teams from around the world compete, and the
atmosphere in the stadium was electric. I got to meet a bunch of
Norwegians who offered me to let them stay with them up in Oslo! So Iâ€™ll
be going in the summer of 2023 to see if theyâ€™re still down for
that.</p>
<p>Apart from the volleyball tournament, there was so much to see and do
in Rome. I visited famous landmarks like the Colosseum, the Vatican, and
the Pantheon, and each one was more impressive than the last. The
history and art in Rome are breathtaking, and itâ€™s incredible to think
about the stories that each monument and building holds.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed wandering around the city, getting lost in the narrow
streets and stumbling upon hidden treasures. Rome is a city that rewards
exploration, and I loved discovering new places and experiences.</p>
<p>Of course, no trip to Rome is complete without trying the food. From
pizza and pasta to gelato and espresso, every meal was a culinary
adventure. Mauro took me to his favorite local spots, where we indulged
in delicious dishes and soaked up the atmosphere. And let me tell you
the carbonara was so so so good!! I still dream of that pasta dish to
this day.</p>
<p>Overall, my three weeks in Rome were a fantastic experience. Staying
with a local gave me a unique perspective on the city, and the FIVB
tournament added an extra layer of excitement. Rome is a city that has
so much to offer, from its history and culture to its food and
nightlife. Itâ€™s a place that I will always hold dear to my heart, and I
canâ€™t wait to go back and explore more.</p>
<p>One last thing btwâ€¦ There is a spot in Rome called Yellow Door Hostel
Bar that was so incredible! I went only twice, but I had the best time
ever! If I wasnâ€™t staying on the other side of town, I would have gone
more often. I met so many friendly faces there! And every time I went,
there were hardly any outdoor spots to sit, so you would have to share a
table with other people there. Which ends up building some long term
relationships with these people. And everyone spoke English too which
was huge!</p>

<h3>Week of June 20th</h3>
<p>Dubrovnik is a picturesque city located on the Adriatic coast of
Croatia. Itâ€™s known for its stunning medieval architecture, charming
streets, and crystal-clear waters. I had the opportunity to explore this
beautiful city for a week, and it was an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>One of the things that stood out to me about Dubrovnik was its
history. The city has been around for centuries and has gone through
many transformations over the years. I had the chance to walk along the
ancient city walls and admire the stunning views of the red-tiled roofs
and the sparkling sea. It was fascinating to see how the city has
evolved over the centuries, and I felt like I was stepping back in
time.</p>
<p>Another highlight of my trip was exploring the Old Town. The
cobblestone streets, stone buildings, and charming squares were like
something out of a fairy tale. I spent hours wandering through the
narrow alleys and admiring the architecture. The city is so well
preserved that itâ€™s easy to imagine what life was like in the past. I
felt like Hulk in Endgameâ€¦ SO MANY STAIRS. I got a nice butt workout
from this experience. It was really hot there too, so I was a sweaty
mess.</p>
<p>Of course, no trip to Dubrovnik is complete without spending time by
the sea. The beaches and coves in Dubrovnik are some of the most
beautiful Iâ€™ve ever seen. I spent several afternoons swimming in the
clear water and sunbathing on the rocky beaches. It was a wonderful way
to relax and take in the natural beauty of the city.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Dubrovnik was an amazing adventure. The city is
full of history, culture, and natural beauty. I loved exploring the Old
Town, swimming in the sea, and trying the delicious food. Itâ€™s a place
that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and
unforgettable travel experience.</p>
<p>I mean and living in Kingâ€™s Landing for a week was dope too. I was
just listing to the theme music for hours on end. I recommend walking
along the wall in the Old City. Best walk around the city Iâ€™ve had! Plus
youâ€™re up so high without any railings, so thatâ€™s a thrill too.</p>
<p>I stayed in an Airbnb in the Port of Dubrovnik, so I got to see a
beautiful view from my pad every day while I worked over there.</p>

<h3>Weekend of June 25th</h3>
<p>Zagreb is the capital of Croatia and a vibrant city with a rich
history and culture. I had the opportunity to explore this charming city
for a weekend and it was a fantastic experience. I also took a quick
visit to Plitvice Lakes National Park, which was a highlight of my
trip.</p>
<p>Zagreb has a fascinating history thatâ€™s reflected in its architecture
and culture. The city is a blend of medieval and modern, with colorful
buildings, narrow streets, and spacious parks. I spent most of my time
wandering around the streets and exploring the local markets. The city
has a lively atmosphere with street musicians, cafes, and bars. It was a
great place to soak up the local culture.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the Plitvice Lakes
National Park. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the
most beautiful natural wonders of Croatia. The park features a series of
cascading waterfalls, crystal-clear lakes, and lush green forests. I
spent several hours hiking around the park and admiring the stunning
scenery. It was a peaceful and magical experience that left me in awe. I
took a picture of a waterfall while I was on a waterfall!!</p>
<p>Back in Zagreb, I enjoyed trying the local cuisine. Croatian food is
delicious and diverse, with influences from Italy, Austria, and the
Balkans. I tried traditional dishes like grilled meats, seafood, and
pasta, and I also enjoyed the local wines and spirits. The local markets
are also a great place to sample fresh fruits, vegetables, and
cheeses.</p>
<p>Overall, my weekend trip to Zagreb with a quick visit to Plitvice was
a wonderful adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and great
food. Plitvice Lakes National Park was a stunning natural wonder that
left me breathless. Itâ€™s a place that I would highly recommend to anyone
looking for a unique and unforgettable travel experience.</p>
<p>Also, I got to hostel with Janella! And that was a blast! What a fun
time with a fun person! And I stayed in my very first hostel and got to
experience that type of craziness and cool people!</p>
<p>Oh btw, on my way to Plitvice I missed my bus stop so I got off and
started walking back towards Plitvice and ended up getting a ride from a
nice stranger. And I didnâ€™t get murdered! Hurray!</p>

<h3>Week of June 27th</h3>
<p>Split is a charming coastal city located in southern Croatia. Itâ€™s
known for its beautiful beaches, stunning architecture, and vibrant
nightlife (of which I didnâ€™t partake since I am not huge into loud
clubs). I had the opportunity to explore this wonderful city for a week,
and it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip to Split was exploring the historic
Old Town. The city is over 1,700 years old, and itâ€™s packed with
incredible sights and sounds. I spent hours wandering through the narrow
streets, admiring the beautiful architecture, and exploring the local
markets. One of the must-see sights in Split is the Diocletianâ€™s Palace,
which was built in the 4th century and is now a UNESCO World Heritage
Site.</p>
<p>Another highlight of my trip was the local cuisine. Croatian food is
delicious and diverse, and Split is a great place to sample it. I tried
traditional dishes like grilled fish and meat, fresh seafood, and pasta.
I also enjoyed the local wines and spirits, which added to the
experience.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Split was a fantastic adventure. The city is full
of history, culture, and natural beauty. I loved exploring the Old Town,
trying the delicious food, and spending time by the sea. The vibrant
nightlife was also a highlight of my trip. Itâ€™s a place that I would
highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>Another round of hitting the hostel in this town too! I had a fun
little time over there exploring the city on the last few days with
Janella again!</p>

<h3>Weekend of July 1st</h3>
<p>So this was a crazy weekend. It started on a delayed flight from
Split to Milan. Then I took a train over to Como to see how beautiful
the lake was over there and also to go to that mansion where Attack of
the Clones was filmed. Butttt I didnâ€™t have time because I needed to
make a bus from Milan to Nice. And I ended up missing my bus anyways
because of train delays! I was so close to making it too! Oh well. I
payed for an overpriced bus ticket to get from Milan to Nice with a stop
in Lyon. But the stop in Lyon was excellent! I had an amazing macaron
and an amazing croissant! I dream about that! Omg!</p>
<p>Anyways, I ended up making it to Nice with very little sleep on that
bus ride, but heyâ€¦ I made it.</p>
<p>Nice is a beautiful coastal city located in the south of France. Itâ€™s
known for its stunning beaches, colorful buildings, and vibrant culture.
I had the opportunity to explore this charming city for a weekend with
Daphney, and it was an incredible experience. I also had the chance to
meet two fun guys from Miami who offered to take me on a day trip to
Monaco since. Part of the fun of these trips is getting to meet new
people and it is so easy to meet new people when I am with a fun person
on that trip. So thank you, Daphney for making it easy to make friends
with these people.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about Nice was the beautiful
architecture. The city is full of colorful buildings, narrow streets,
and quaint cafes. I spent most of my time exploring the local markets,
trying the delicious food, and soaking up the local culture. Nice has a
lively atmosphere with street performers, musicians, and artists. It was
a great place to relax and take in the local scenery.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was meeting the two guys at my
Airbnb who invited me to join them on a day trip to Monaco. They had a
cabana at this club overlooking the sea on one side and the speedway
track on the other and offered to take me along for free. It was an
incredible experience. We spent the day swimming in the pool and
pretending to be rich. We met other people who were probably doing the
same exact thing. Monaco is a stunning city with luxurious buildings and
beautiful scenery. We visited the famous Monte Carlo casino and enjoyed
the local shops and restaurants. It was a great day and one that I will
never forget.</p>
<p>Back in Nice, I also spent the evening hiking up to the castle at the
top of the hill. I find all of France just has an atmosphere of
romanticism. I loved seeing the lights at night and all of the beauty of
the city from above.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Iâ€™m an idiot for not having ratatouille in Franceâ€¦</p>
<p>Overall, my weekend trip to Nice with a day trip to Monaco was a
fantastic adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and natural
beauty. The local cuisine was delicious, and the beaches were stunning.
The chance encounter with the two fun guys from Miami who took me to
Monaco was a highlight of my trip. Itâ€™s a place that I would highly
recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>Also, the beaches are pebbly beaches, so I recommend sandals or
shoes. So watch out for that.</p>

<h3>Week of July 4th</h3>
<p>Happy Independence Day! First one I have experienced being away from
the US.</p>
<p>Marseille is a beautiful city located in the south of France. Itâ€™s
known for its stunning coastline, historic landmarks, and vibrant
culture. I had the opportunity to spend a week exploring this charming
city and even took a day trip to Paris.</p>
<p>Marseille has a rich history and a unique culture. The city is full
of historic landmarks, including the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde, a
beautiful basilica perched on a hill overlooking the city. I also
visited the Old Port, a bustling area filled with restaurants, cafes,
and shops. The locals are friendly and welcoming, and I enjoyed chatting
with them and learning more about their way of life.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was a day trip to Paris. Itâ€™s only a
three-hour train ride from Marseille, so it was easy to take a day trip.
I visited some of the most famous landmarks in Paris, including the
Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. It was a busy
day, but I managed to see a lot of the city in a short amount of time.
And Phoebe Hung let me stay at her place and also play tour guide to the
city she was living in for the summer! Crazy enough was I never actually
had a real conversation with Phoebe until Paris and then we ended up
talking for 8 hours! That was crazy!</p>
<p>Back in Marseille, I spent time exploring the local beaches. But
really just one beach in particular. I am too lazy right now to look it
up, but I played so much volleyball with the locals over there! Just by
saying I played volleyball in California, they automatically took me in
and saw me as an expert (even though I have been playing for 16 years, I
still donâ€™t consider myself an expert). But hey, I played with some
French people and that was a fun time!</p>
<p>The local cuisine was another highlight of my trip. Marseille is
famous for its seafood, and I enjoyed some of the freshest and most
delicious seafood Iâ€™ve ever had. I also tried traditional dishes like
bouillabaisse, a fish stew that originated in the area, and enjoyed
local wines and spirits.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Marseille with a day trip to Paris was a
fantastic adventure. The city is full of history, culture, and natural
beauty. The locals are friendly and welcoming, and the food is
delicious. The day trip to Paris was a great way to see some of the most
famous landmarks in the world, and Iâ€™m glad I took the time to explore
this beautiful city. Itâ€™s a trip that I will never forget and one that I
would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable
travel experience.</p>
<p>I also hungout with some people at the local hostel bar! Which I
should remember to do that sooner in my travels so I can make friends
earlier. But whatever, still a fun time!</p>

<h3>Week of July 11th</h3>
<p>Barcelona is a vibrant city located on the northeastern coast of
Spain. Itâ€™s known for its stunning architecture, delicious food, and
lively culture. I had the opportunity to spend a week exploring this
incredible city, and it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting the iconic Sagrada
Familia, a massive basilica that has been under construction since 1882.
The intricate details and stunning design of the basilica were truly
breathtaking, and it was amazing to see the progress that has been made
on this incredible structure.</p>
<p>I walked along La Rambla, a bustling street lined with shops,
restaurants, and street performers, and explored the Gothic Quarter, a
historic area filled with narrow streets, beautiful buildings, and
fascinating history.</p>
<p>The food in Barcelona was another highlight of my trip. I indulged in
traditional dishes like paella and patatas bravas. I also enjoyed
delicious tapas and local wines, and explored the cityâ€™s vibrant food
scene. Of course I had sangriaâ€¦ I mean come on.</p>
<p>Aside from the cityâ€™s attractions, I also spent time relaxing on the
beach and taking in the beautiful Mediterranean Sea. Barcelona has some
of the best beaches in Europe, and it was a great way to unwind and soak
up the sun.</p>
<p>And of course there was so much volleyball every single day! That
place was awesome!!! Iâ€™ve never been welcomed by so many people before!
Seriously the nicest people to ever play the sport and just welcome in
strangers like no problem. That would never happen in the US to
strangers. But hey, Europeans are nicer I suppose.</p>
<p>Overall, my week in Barcelona was an incredible experience. The city
is full of history, culture, and natural beauty. The architecture is
stunning, the food is delicious, and the people are friendly and
welcoming. Itâ€™s a trip that I will never forget and one that I would
highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable travel
experience.</p>
<p>And hey that was the end of my 2022 Euro Trip. Come back shortly for
my 2023 Euro Tripâ€¦</p>

<div id="my-first-autumn-october-30th---november-13th"
class="section level3">
<h3>My First Autumn (October 30th - November 13th)</h3>
<p>Autumn is a beautiful season in the northeastern United States, with
the changing leaves creating a stunning display of colors. I had the
opportunity to spend two weeks in November exploring the area around New
Brunswick, New York City, and Philadelphia, and it was an incredible
trip.</p>
<p>I started my trip with New York City, which was bustling with energy
and excitement. And it was warm! It was like 72 degrees as the high when
I was there. I thought I needed to bring more sweats and sweatshirts on
my trip, but surprisingly, I didnâ€™t need them! The city was also filled
with beautiful autumn leaves, especially in Central Park. I spent a day
exploring the park, taking in the colorful foliage and enjoying the
crisp fall air. I spent a lot of time playing volleyball and walking as
much as I could! When I was able to wander and spend more time around
the city, I skipped the subway and chose to walk the 10 miles. It was
beautiful as a California native! I got to see Alex Morris for the 4th
time this year! Truly the nicest person I have ever met and it was
lovely seeing her! I hope she and Max get engaged!</p>
<p>Also, I got to stay in the Lower East Side with a friend and she had
an incredible high rise apartment with an awesome view! Such a cool
experience being there!</p>
<p>Next, I headed to New Brunswick, NJ, where I stayed with friends
(Mina and Ted - who are moving to California in March 2023!) who showed
me around the area. They live next to this beautiful tree filled with
reds, oranges, and yellows in their leaves and my eyes were truly seeing
some true beauty for the first time.</p>
<p>From there, I took a short train ride to Philadelphia, which was also
full of autumn beauty. I explored the historic Old City neighborhood,
where I saw the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, and visited the
beautiful Fairmount Park, which was full of colorful trees and peaceful
trails. I got to see my cousin, Blake, and met his son, Wesley, for the
first time! Such a fun time over there!</p>
<p>Throughout my trip, I always try some tasty foods and I will always
go to Joeâ€™s Pizza whenever Iâ€™m in NYC. I also went to a club in NYC
where they played â€˜Empire State of Mindâ€™ which everyone lost their shit
over. Also had Philly cheesesteak for the first time. In Philadelphia!
Crazy stuff, I know.</p>
<p>Overall, my two-week trip to New Brunswick, NJ, NYC, and Philly to
see autumn leaves was a beautiful and memorable experience. I highly
recommend this trip to anyone who wants to explore the natural beauty
and vibrant culture of the northeastern United States in the fall.</p>
