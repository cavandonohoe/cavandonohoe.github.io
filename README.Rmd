# Cavan's Website

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of website is to display some fun side projects I have been working on. Movie data intrigues me, so I scraped IMDb to use some of their clean data. I have looked into COVID-19 data to see daily case and death updates as well as seeing vaccine trends. I also have my resume here too.
