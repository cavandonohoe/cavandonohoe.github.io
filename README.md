# Cavanâ€™s Website

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of website is to display some fun side projects I have been
working on. Movie data intrigues me, so I scraped IMDb to use some of
their clean data. I have looked into COVID-19 data to see daily case and
death updates as well as seeing vaccine trends. I also have my resume
here too.
