If you have read the [*About Me*](https://cavandonohoe.github.io/about.html) section, you know of my passion for Data Science and making people's work easier. I have realized some older systems need improving. Sometimes Microsoft Excel (even when you have formulas), can bog down the run time given all the lingering manual work.

R and RStudio have made my automation goals extremely achievable. I have helped with tasks such as:

- Help actuarial teams improve their rate adjustment process (8 hours a week down to 1 minute)
- Help accounting teams clean and analyze QuickBooks data (10 hours a week down to 30 seconds)
- Help financial teams send out summary reports (4 hours a week down to 1 minute)
- Make R packages with version control to document various analyses

Let's have a conversation so I can help improve your team's workflow.
